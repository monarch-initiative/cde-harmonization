It is composed of poorly differentiated neoplastic astrocytes and it is characterized by the presence of cellular polymorphism, nuclear atypia, brisk mitotic activity, vascular thrombosis, microvascular proliferation and necrosis.

It may develop from diffuse astrocytoma WHO grade II or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastoma), but more frequently, it manifests after a short clinical history de novo, without evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion (primary glioblastoma). Two histologic variants are recognized: giant cell glioblastoma and gliosarcoma.
