Medical device has to be designed with rigorous safety standards. There are several basic types of medical devices: life support equipment used to maintain a patient's body functions; therapeutic equipment; monitors and detectors to measure the indexes of a patient's state; imagine machines and laboratory equipment used with diagnostic and status monitoring purposes. In insurance parlance, the term is usually synonymous with assistive device, although it may include medical supplies.","longName":"C17612:C16830","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Central Venous Access Catheter","conceptCode":"C17612","definition":"A venous catheter positioned with the tip in the proximal third of the superior vena cava, the right atrium, or the inferior vena cava.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Medical Device","conceptCode":"C16830","definition":"Any physical object that is useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"3BAE9246-4A8A-1C30-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-10-04","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2007-10-04","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2007-10-04","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2685421","version":"1","preferredName":"Implantation","preferredDefinition":"A surgical procedure that places something in the human body.","longName":"C51982","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Implantation","conceptCode":"C51982","definition":"A surgical procedure that places something in the human body.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"3BAE9246-4A9B-1C30-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-10-04","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2007-10-04","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2007-10-04","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008538","version":"1","preferredName":"Therapies","preferredDefinition":"actions or administration of therapeutic agents to produce an effect that is intended to alter the course of a pathologic process (NCI).","longName":"TX","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B214D04D-9F05-1CA5-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-18","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"3BAD4494-BA6D-1432-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-10-04","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2007-10-04","modifiedBy":"CAMPBELB","dateModified":"2017-09-05","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"5917002","version":"1","preferredName":"Central Venous Access Catheter Type","preferredDefinition":"A tube surgically placed into a blood vessel for the purpose of giving intravenous fluid and drugs.
