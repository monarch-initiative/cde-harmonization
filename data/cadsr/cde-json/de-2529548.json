They share high-quality, arrayed cDNA libraries and place sequence, map, and expression data on the clones in these arrays into the public domain. The human and mouse genomes were the first to be studied, and the collection now contains clones from rat, zebrafish, Fugu, Xenopus and rhesus macaque. They anticipate arraying (and sharing) cDNA libraries from additional species over time. A majority of their clones are publicly available, free of any royalties, and may be used by anyone agreeing with their guidelines.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Clone","conceptCode":"C37925","definition":"A group of genetically identical cells, organisms, or DNA molecules.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"207D3CBB-9120-3E5C-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-10-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CABIO","dateCreated":"2006-10-23","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2223251","version":"1","preferredName":"CDNA Length","preferredDefinition":"Single-stranded complementary DNA synthesized from an RNA template by the action of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. cDNA (i.e., complementary DNA, not circular DNA, not C-DNA) is used in a variety of molecular cloning experiments as well as serving as a specific hybridization probe.:Single-stranded complementary DNA synthesized from an RNA template by the action of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. cDNA (i.e., complementary DNA, not circular DNA, not C-DNA) is used in a variety of molecular cloning experiments as well as serving as a specific hybridization probe.","longName":"C324:C25334","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"cDNA","conceptCode":"C324","definition":"Single-stranded DNA that is complementary to messenger RNA or DNA that has been synthesized from messenger RNA by reverse transcriptase.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Length","conceptCode":"C25334","definition":"The linear extent in space from one end of something to the other end, or the extent of something from beginning to end.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F629F871-F20D-1EEF-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-02","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER","dateCreated":"2005-05-02","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2222502","version":"1","preferredName":"UML DEFAULT CD","preferredDefinition":"Default Conceptual Domain for UML Loader","longName":"UML DEFAULT CD","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F5E53F3B-47A4-52D1-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2005-04-29","modifiedBy":"DWARZEL","dateModified":"2021-04-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"207D43BB-2832-4473-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-10-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CABIO","dateCreated":"2006-10-23","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2178534","version":"1","preferredName":"java.lang.Long","preferredDefinition":"Generic value domain for a primitive java dataype that is a long integer (64-bit two's complement).","longName":"java.lang.Long","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"java.lang.Long","minLength":null,"maxLength":null,"minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2178532","version":"1","preferredName":"Bioinformatics","preferredDefinition":".","longName":"BIOINFORMATICS","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RETIRED ARCHIVED","registrationStatus":"Retired","id":"CD81DD3C-8FFA-28BA-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-12-02","endDate":"2020-10-14","createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-12-02","modifiedBy":"TAYLORT","dateModified":"2020-10-14","changeDescription":"10.14.20 TL changed WFS from DRAFT NEW to RETIRED ARCHIVED and added an End Date in preparation of OneData.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2233101","version":"1","preferredName":"Number","preferredDefinition":"Number;
