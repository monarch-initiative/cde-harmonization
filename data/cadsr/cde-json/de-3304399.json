Breast carcinoma may affect both females and males.  It is the most common malignant tumor and the leading cause of carcinoma death in women.  Risk factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens, contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation.  The widespread use of mammography has contributed in the detection of very early cancerous lesions (less than 2mm in diameter).  The vast majority of breast carcinomas are adenocarcinomas (ductal or lobular).  Breast carcinoma spreads by direct invasion, by the lymphatic route, and by the blood vessel route.  The most common site of lymph node involvment is the axilla.  Breast carcinomas infrequently occur in males (particularly elderly individuals and patients with Klinefelter's syndrome).  The therapy of breat carcinoma includes surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, depending on the type and extend of the disease. --2002:Elements of a personal medical history which are necessary to allow an individual to participate in a specific clinical trial.","longName":"C14174:C94255:C4872:CL008804","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Metastatic","conceptCode":"C14174","definition":"A term referring to the clinical or pathologic observation of a tumor extension from its original site of growth to another anatomic site.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"3"},{"longName":"Unresected","conceptCode":"C94255","definition":"Describes an organ, tissue, or cancer that has not been either partly or completely removed by surgery.","evsSource":"CTCAE_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Breast Carcinoma","conceptCode":"C4872","definition":"A carcinoma arising from the breast, most commonly the terminal ductal-lobular unit.
