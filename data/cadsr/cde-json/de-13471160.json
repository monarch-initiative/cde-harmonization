Leukemia is usually associated with anemia, fever, hemorrhagic episodes, and splenomegaly. Common leukemias include acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment is vital to patient survival; untreated, the natural course of acute leukemias is normally measured in weeks or months, while that of chronic leukemias is more often measured in months or years.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"98F258D4-9F60-3E56-E040-BB89AD436715","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-01-03","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2011-01-03","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"FA2891D3-6A11-23E5-E053-731AD00A8E6C","beginDate":"2023-04-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SOKKERL","dateCreated":"2023-04-25","modifiedBy":"SOKKERL","dateModified":"2023-04-25","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Lipomatous Neoplasms","valueDescription":null,"ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"6156330","version":"1","preferredName":"Lipomatous Neoplasm","longName":"6156330","preferredDefinition":"A benign, intermediate, or malignant mesenchymal neoplasm composed of adipose (fatty) tissue.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Lipomatous Neoplasm","conceptCode":"C4248","definition":"A benign, intermediate, or malignant mesenchymal neoplasm composed of adipose (fatty) tissue.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"68A3820C-EF87-5640-E053-F662850AA127","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2018-03-30","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2018-03-30","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-03-30","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"FA2891D3-6A12-23E5-E053-731AD00A8E6C","beginDate":"2023-04-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SOKKERL","dateCreated":"2023-04-25","modifiedBy":"SOKKERL","dateModified":"2023-04-25","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Lymphatic Vessel Tumors","valueDescription":null,"ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"6156328","version":"1","preferredName":"Lymphatic Vessel Neoplasm","longName":"6156328","preferredDefinition":"A benign or malignant neoplasm arising from the lymphatic vessels.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Lymphatic Vessel Neoplasm","conceptCode":"C3723","definition":"A benign or malignant neoplasm arising from the lymphatic vessels.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"68A3820C-EF61-5640-E053-F662850AA127","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2018-03-30","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2018-03-30","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-03-30","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"FA2891D3-6A13-23E5-E053-731AD00A8E6C","beginDate":"2023-04-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SOKKERL","dateCreated":"2023-04-25","modifiedBy":"SOKKERL","dateModified":"2023-04-25","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Mast Cell Neoplasm","valueDescription":null,"ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"4264929","version":"1","preferredName":"Mast Cell Neoplasm","longName":"4264929","preferredDefinition":"A heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the abnormal growth and accumulation of mast cells in one or more organ systems.
