In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F600421C-6691-0246-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-05","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-05-05","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-05","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2224892","version":"1","preferredName":"Not Complete","preferredDefinition":"Not; used for negation of a word or group of words.:Complete; having every necessary or normal part or component or step; or having come or been brought to a conclusion.","longName":"C25594:C25250","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","Concepts":[{"longName":"Negation","conceptCode":"C25594","definition":"An operation in which a term denies or inverts the meaning of another term or construction.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Complete","conceptCode":"C25250","definition":"To possess every necessary or normal part or component or step; having come or been brought to a conclusion.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F600421C-66A9-0246-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-05-06","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008551","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessments","preferredDefinition":"evaluations of the patient and the patient's disease.","longName":"ASSESS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B22DA727-6718-5A2D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F600421C-66AB-0246-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-05-06","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2224900","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessment Period Specify","preferredDefinition":"the free-text field related to the specified assessment period.","longName":"ASSESS_PD_SPEC","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"CHARACTER","minLength":"1","maxLength":"100","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008551","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessments","preferredDefinition":"evaluations of the patient and the patient's disease.","longName":"ASSESS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B22DA727-6718-5A2D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2224899","version":"1","preferredName":"Period Specify","preferredDefinition":"An interval of time.
