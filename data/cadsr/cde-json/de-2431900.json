{"DataElement":{"publicId":"2431900","version":"1","preferredName":"Radical Prostatectomy Gleason Histopathologic Grade Total Gleason Score Integer","preferredDefinition":"The Gleason score is an integer representing the sum of the primary (most predominant) Gleason grade and the secondary (second most predominant) Gleason grade. Where no secondary Gleason grade exists, the primary Gleason grade is doubled to arrive at a Gleason score. In needle biopsy specimens in which more than 2 patterns are present and the worst grade is neither the predominant nor the secondary grade, the predominant and the highest grade should be chosen to arrive at a score (eg, 60% grade 3, 30% grade 2, 10% grade 4 is scored as 3+4=7). When multiple needle biopsy specimens are submitted and they have differing Gleason scores, an overall (composite) Gleason score for the case should be clearly reported in a note. In radical prostatectomy specimens, in which more than 1 separate tumor is identified, the Gleason scores of the individual tumors may be reported separately or, at the very least, the Gleason score of the most significant lesion should be recorded. For instance, if there is a large Gleason score 5 transition zone cancer and a separate smaller Gleason score 7 peripheral zone cancer, both scores or the latter score should be reported rather than the scores being averaged. At the very least, there should be some indication of the presence of Gleason pattern 4 accounting for the Gleason score 7 tumor.","longName":"2431503v1.0:2434127v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"2431503","version":"1","preferredName":"Radical Prostatectomy Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer Total Gleason Score For Prostate Cancer","preferredDefinition":"Surgery to remove the entire prostate.
