Mutations can range from a single base change to the loss of a significant portion of a chromosome. These occur when DNA is not repaired prior to replication. Mutations in germ cells can be inherited. However, in somatic cells, they are not inherited. Somatic mutations can arise via exposure to chemical mutagens or ionizing radiation.
