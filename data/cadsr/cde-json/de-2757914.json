Inhibition of both MEK1 and 2 by selumetinib prevents the activation of MEK1/2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, thereby leading to an inhibition of cellular proliferation in various cancers.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Selumetinib","conceptCode":"C66939","definition":"An orally active, small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity.
