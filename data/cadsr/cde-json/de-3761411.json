{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3761411","version":"1","preferredName":"Material Process Step Intervention or Procedure Performed Study Activity Date and Time Range ISO21090.IVL.TS.DATETIME.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"The completed act of processing a material. EXAMPLE(S): freezing, thawing, spinning, embedding, dividing, aliquot, adding additives or growth factors OTHER NAME(S): product manipulation NOTE(S): Material process may be performed on any kind of material, such as specimen, nanomaterial, or biologic. The result of the process may be similar or different kind of material, e.g. specimen may be result of specimen processing step (aliquot or division of a specimen), or alternatively blood product has anticoagulants added to it to preserve product. Other processing steps, e.g. adding growth factor to induce cell growth, may be performed on blood product. The date and time span when this activity began and ended. EXAMPLE(S): (1) Date and time when sample is taken from subject. (2) Chemotherapy dose given on June 12th starting 9am, finishing 12pm. NOTE(S): (1) Whether administrative or preparatory activities are included in this time frame is up to whoever is defining the activity - this time frame is all that matters when the activity occurred. (2) Date range is an interval data type, i.e. has a beginning (low) and end (high) values; is also TS.DATETIME data type, i.e. dates can have uncertain values (e.g., a range). So, if subject was diagnosed w/ leukemia sometime in 2009 and had transplant (substance administration) sometime in 2010, can surmise subject had preparative regimen between those times. I.e. preparative regimen would have beginning (low) date range of between 2009-01-01 and 2009-12-31; and ending (high) date range of between 2010-01-01 and 2010-12-31: IVL<TS.DATETIME>.low.uncertainRange.low = 2009-01-01, IVL<TS.DATETIME>.low.uncertainRange.high = 2009-12-31, IVL<TS.DATETIME>.high.uncertainRange.low = 2010-01-01, IVL<TS.DATETIME>.high.uncertainRange.high = 2010-12-31; [times left out to keep it simple.]","longName":"3760608v1.0:3152480v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760608","version":"1","preferredName":"Material Process Step Intervention or Procedure Performed Study Activity Date and Time Range","preferredDefinition":"The tangible substance that goes into the makeup of a physical object.:A sequence of events which produces some outcome.:A specific stage of progression through a sequential process.:An activity that produces an effect, or that is intended to alter the course of a disease in a patient or population.
