SYN pulmo.:The edge or border of the tissue removed in cancer surgery.  The margin is described as negative or clean when the pathologist finds no cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of the cancer has been removed.  The margin is described as positive or involved when the pathologist finds cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of the cancer has not been removed.","longName":"C12468:C41227","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Lung","conceptCode":"C12468","definition":"One of a pair of viscera occupying the pulmonary cavities of the thorax, the organs of respiration in which aeration of the blood takes place.
