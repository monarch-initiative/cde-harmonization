A coded value specifying the anatomic location or access point for an observation. EXAMPLE(S): Anus for a colonoscopy observation NOTE(S): (1) Neither target anatomic site nor approach anatomic site is necessarily required or relevant for certain observations, however if either or both are present then the distinction between them is that the approach site is the access point for the measurement or observation and the target site is what is ultimately being evaluated. (2) Anatomic site and laterality both are included in this concept.","longName":"3760254v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760254","version":"1","preferredName":"Product Investigation Observation
