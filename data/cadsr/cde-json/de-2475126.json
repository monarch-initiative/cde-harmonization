When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Other Imaging Modalities","conceptCode":"C19343","definition":"Imaging methods not listed.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Gallium Scan","conceptCode":"C38087","definition":"A nuclear imaging procedure in which an isotope of gallium is used as the radiopharmaceutical.
