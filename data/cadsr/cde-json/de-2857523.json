(American Heritage Dictionary):A malignant tumor usually arising from the epithelium lining the large intestinal mucosa.  Colon carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies in both males and females, and is especially common in North America and Europe.  Grossly, most colon carcinomas are polypoid or ulcerating lesions. Microscopically, adenocarcinoma is the most frequently seen morphologic subtype.
