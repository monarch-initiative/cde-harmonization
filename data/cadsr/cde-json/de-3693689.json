This cytosolic protein, a heterodimer of disulfide-linked alpha and beta chains, is produced in pancreatic islet beta cells. Binding of insulin to its receptor stimulates glucose uptake, accelerates both glycolysis and the pentose phosphate cycle and increases glycogen synthesis in the liver. Insulin regulates protein and lipid metabolism. It also decreases blood glucose concentration by shuttling molecules into cells to be used for energy. Decreased expression of insulin protein causes familial hyperproinsulinemia.","longName":"2425597v1.0:3070717v1.0","context":"PhenX","contextVersion":"1","ObjectClass":{"publicId":"2425597","version":"1","preferredName":"Hematology","preferredDefinition":"Hematology; the branch of medicine that deals with the blood and blood-forming organs and the diseases thereof.","longName":"C16673","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Hematology","conceptCode":"C16673","definition":"The branch of medicine that deals with the blood and blood-forming organs and the diseases thereof.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"049B5946-27F2-2FE1-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-11-02","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PWEST","dateCreated":"2005-11-02","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-11-02","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"3070717","version":"1","preferredName":"Fasting Serum Insulin Laboratory Procedure","preferredDefinition":"Abstaining from food.:The clear liquid part of the blood that remains after blood cells and clotting proteins have been removed.:(IN-su-lin) A hormone made by the islet cells of the pancreas.
