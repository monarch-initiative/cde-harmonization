When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F7C5DB4E-AC57-18B5-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-05-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"3162379","version":"1","preferredName":"Urination Post Imaging Agent","preferredDefinition":"the discharge of urine.:Post; occuring after.:A compound that enables or improves the visualization of body structures or functions for medical imaging.","longName":"C25744:C38008:C1966","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Urination","conceptCode":"C25744","definition":"The discharge of urine.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Post","conceptCode":"C38008","definition":"Happening at a time subsequent to a reference time; later in time or order.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Imaging Agent","conceptCode":"C1966","definition":"A compound that enables or improves the visualization of body structures or functions for medical imaging.","evsSource":"CTCAE_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"959E596E-8C6B-D207-E040-BB89AD4355A9","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-11-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2010-11-22","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-11-22","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2233241","version":"1","preferredName":"Medical Imaging","preferredDefinition":"Events, people, materials and activities uniquely defined by medical imaging.
