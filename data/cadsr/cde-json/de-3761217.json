NOTE(S): A randomization book is a predefined set of assignments to portions of a study based on criteria, such as stratum group for example, that ensures a desired distribution of experimental units across those portions of the study. For example, the book entries indicate which arm a given experimental unit, Joe, is assigned to based on the fact that he's the 5th person in stratum group #2. An integer falling within minimum and maximum bounds that specifies how many times the planned activity occurs. NOTE(S): If the frequency is more than once a day, this is still interpreted per time, e.g. BID for 5 days is 10 repeats.","longName":"3760425v1.0:3152485v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760425","version":"1","preferredName":"Book Randomization Allocation Plan Study Activity Repeat Quantity Range","preferredDefinition":"A volume made up of pages fastened along one edge and enclosed between protective covers.
