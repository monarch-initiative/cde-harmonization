For the question, \"Have you smoked in the last 2 months\", the focalDateRange would be an expression referencing a variable that represents the PerformedObservation.actualDateRange (a value yet to be defined) and a formula for the date range between when the question is asked (PerformedObservation.actualDateRange.low) and 2 months prior (PerformedObservation.actualDateRange.low - 2 months).","longName":"3175472v1.0:3152478v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3175472","version":"1","preferredName":"Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria Observation Reuse Template Study Activity Foci Date and Time Range","preferredDefinition":"Characteristics which are necessary to allow a subject to participate in a clinical study, as outlined in the study protocol.
