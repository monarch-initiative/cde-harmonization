Scans often used in diagnosing, staging, and monitoring disease include liver scans, bone scans, and computed tomography (CT) or computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. In liver scanning and bone scanning, radioactive substances that are injected into the bloodstream collect in these organs. A scanner that detects the radiation is used to create pictures. In CT scanning, an x-ray machine linked to a computer is used to produce detailed pictures of organs inside the body. MRI scans use a large magnet connected to a computer to create pictures of areas inside the body.","longName":"C17999","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Scan","conceptCode":"C17999","definition":"The data or image obtained by gathering information with a sensing device.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"0781A8FE-5439-0C0C-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-12-12","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2005-12-12","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-12-12","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"4971295","version":"1","preferredName":"Payment Criterion Submission Requirement","preferredDefinition":"A sum of money paid.:That which constitutes a standard from which a judgment can be established, a reference point against which other things can be evaluated, or a basis for comparison.:Something submitted for the judgment or consideration of others.:Something that is a necessary condition; something that is obligatory.","longName":"C25371:C25466:C25694:C25652","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Payment","conceptCode":"C25371","definition":"A sum of money paid.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"3"},{"longName":"Criterion","conceptCode":"C25466","definition":"That which constitutes a standard from which a judgment can be established, a reference point against which other things can be evaluated, or a basis for comparison.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Submission","conceptCode":"C25694","definition":"Something submitted for the judgment or consideration of others.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Requirement","conceptCode":"C25652","definition":"Something that is a necessary condition; something that is obligatory.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"1D4FDFEB-E2D3-BD4B-E050-BB89AD43797F","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2015-08-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"HARTLEYG","dateCreated":"2015-08-14","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2015-08-14","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2233241","version":"1","preferredName":"Medical Imaging","preferredDefinition":"Events, people, materials and activities uniquely defined by medical imaging.
