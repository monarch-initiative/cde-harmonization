NOTE(S): This allows questions defined as agnostic criteria in defined eligibility criterion (that is, they could be used either as inclusion or exclusion criteria) to be referenced in specific study protocols and allows the inclusion/exclusion distinction to be determined for that study specifically. An integer falling within minimum and maximum bounds that specifies how many times the planned activity occurs. NOTE(S): If the frequency is more than once a day, this is still interpreted per time, e.g. BID for 5 days is 10 repeats.","longName":"3760722v1.0:3152485v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760722","version":"1","preferredName":"Inclusion Criteria Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria Plan Study Activity Repeat Quantity Range","preferredDefinition":"Medical and/or social characteristics which are necessary for a subject to be allowed to participate in a clinical study, as outlined in the study protocol.
