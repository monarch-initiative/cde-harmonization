Fluticasone binds and activates glucocorticoid receptor, resulting in the activation of lipocortin. Lipocortin, in turn, inhibits cytosolic phospholipase A2, which triggers a cascade of reactions involved in the synthesis of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Secondly, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 1 is induced, thereby leads to dephosphorylation and inactivation of Jun N-terminal kinase directly inhibiting c-Jun mediated transcription. Finally, transcriptional activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B is blocked, thereby inhibits the transcription of cyclooxygenase 2, which is essential for prostaglandin production.","evsSource":"RADLEX_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"852693AD-C70D-32F2-E040-BB89AD436CB9","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-04-26","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2010-04-26","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"8CEC9CF9-F411-77C5-E040-BB89AD437145","beginDate":"2010-04-26","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2010-08-03","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-08-03","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Foretinib","valueDescription":"Multitargeted Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor GSK1363089","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3124282","version":"1","preferredName":"Multitargeted Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor GSK1363089","longName":"3124282","preferredDefinition":"An orally bioavailable small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity.

In Ras-activated cancer cells, reovirus is able to freely replicate and subsequently cause apoptosis in the tumor cells. Cell lysis frees progeny viral particles to infect surrounding cancer cells. This cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until no more Ras-activated tumor cells are available. Because the reovirus kills Ras-activated cancer cells, this is a potential therapeutic for malignant glioma, pancreatic, colon and some lung cancers.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Pelareorep","conceptCode":"C60774","definition":"An isolate of the oncolytic, human wild-type serotype 3 Dearing (T3D) strain of the double-stranded RNA virus reovirus (Respiratory Enteric Orphan virus), with potential oncolytic activity. Upon administration, pelareorep is able to replicate specifically in cancer cells bearing an activated Ras pathway. This induces apoptosis in Ras-activated tumor cells and subsequently frees progeny viral particles to infect, replicate in and induce cell death of surrounding cancer cells. In addition, viral replication causes the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, causing a natural killer (NK)-cell-mediated and a cytotoxic T-cell (CTL)-mediated killing of tumor cells, respectively. Ras-activated tumor cells are deficient in their ability to trigger the antiviral response mediated by the host cellular protein, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR).","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"8C0EAA9F-D646-4F99-E040-BB89AD435CFD","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-07-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2010-07-23","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"8CEC9CF9-F4A7-77C5-E040-BB89AD437145","beginDate":"2010-07-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2010-08-03","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-08-03","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Technetium Tc-99m Apcitide","valueDescription":"Technetium Tc-99m Apcitide","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2939364","version":"1","preferredName":"Technetium Tc-99m Apcitide","longName":"2939364","preferredDefinition":"A radioconjugate comprised of the small peptide apcitide labeled with the gamma-emitting technetium TC99m (metastable Tc-99).

Lipocortin-1 is one factor induced by fluocinolone that interacts with and inhibits cytosolic phospholipase 2 alpha, thereby preventing phospholipase translocation to the perinuclear membrane and subsequent release and conversion of arachidonic acid to inflammatory prostaglandins. In addition, MAPK phosphatase 1 is induced, thereby preventing the triggering of the MAPK cascade resulting in pro-inflammatory effects via Jun N-terminal kinase and c-Jun. Finally, fluocinolone binds to and inhibits nuclear factor kappa-B directly, resulting in inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 transcription and subsequent prostaglandin synthesis.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-F94A-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-11-08","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2005-11-08","modifiedBy":"KUMMEROA","dateModified":"2023-09-01","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"CD82BCC0-12A2-B6BC-E040-BB89AD431513","beginDate":"2012-11-02","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-11-02","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2012-11-02","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"LDK378","valueDescription":"ALK inhibitor LDK378","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3595598","version":"1","preferredName":"ALK inhibitor LDK378","longName":"3595598v1.00","preferredDefinition":"An orally available inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) with antineoplastic activity.

Upon administration of gorilla-derived adenovirus-expressing HPV-6/11 vaccine PRGN-2012, the adenovirus infects and expresses the HPV-6/11 proteins. The expressed proteins stimulate the host immune system to produce antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies and to mount a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against cells infected with HPV-6/11, thereby inducing tumor cell lysis. HPV6/11 play a key role in the development of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP).","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FEA99C1E-696C-78F2-E053-731AD00A730A","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2023-06-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2023-06-21","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2023-06-21","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"FEA9B339-FA76-7B88-E053-731AD00A5931","beginDate":"2023-06-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2023-06-21","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2023-06-21","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Lifitegrast","valueDescription":null,"ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"14059580","version":"1","preferredName":"Lifitegrast (Xiidra)","longName":"14059580v1.00","preferredDefinition":"A tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antagonist, that can be used as an ophthalmic solution for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED; keratoconjunctivitis sicca; dry eye syndrome).
