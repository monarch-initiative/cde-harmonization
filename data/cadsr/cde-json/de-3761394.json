OTHER NAME(S): Amendment NOTE(S): The term \"Amendment\" needs to be disambiguated since it sometimes refers to the amended version of the protocol (study protocol document version) and other times refers to the summary of changes (amendment change summary version) that are applied to a protocol to create a new version of the protocol. A coded value specifying the language that the document is written in. EXAMPLE(S): English, German. NOTE(S): Indicates the language in which all (or most) of discrete data elements that make up document are expressed. Distinct from data type attribute ED.languageCode on document version text attribute which expresses language in which document is rendered. Is most important in circumstances where document is not rendered.","longName":"3760593v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760593","version":"1","preferredName":"Amendment Change Summary Document Version Language Code","preferredDefinition":"A change in a document made by correction, adding, substituting or omitting a certain part.
