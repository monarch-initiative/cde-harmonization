Upon ingestion, caffeine binds to adenosine receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), which inhibits adenosine binding. This inhibits the adenosine-mediated downregulation of CNS activity; thus, stimulating the activity of the medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers in the brain. This agent also promotes neurotransmitter release that further stimulates the CNS. The anti-inflammatory effects of caffeine are due the nonselective competitive inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Inhibition of PDEs raises the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP), activates protein kinase A, and inhibits leukotriene synthesis, which leads to reduced inflammation and innate immunity.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"CNS Stimulant","conceptCode":"C47795","definition":"Any agent capable of having a stimulating effect on the central nervous system (CNS).","evsSource":"CTCAE_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"20D29B95-82FA-6C89-E050-BB89AD437D47","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2015-09-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2015-09-28","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"20D29B95-8313-6C89-E050-BB89AD437D47","beginDate":"2015-09-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2015-09-28","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2015-09-28","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Has intercurrent illness","valueDescription":"Has intercurrent illness","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"5025995","version":"1","preferredName":"Has intercurrent illness","longName":"5025995","preferredDefinition":"Has intercurrent illness","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"20D29B95-831D-6C89-E050-BB89AD437D47","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2015-09-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2015-09-28","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"20D29B95-8336-6C89-E050-BB89AD437D47","beginDate":"2015-09-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2015-09-28","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2015-09-28","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Experienced emotional stress","valueDescription":"Emotional Stress","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"5025996","version":"1","preferredName":"Emotional Stress","longName":"5025996","preferredDefinition":"Excessively affected by emotion.: the biological response to noxious, demanding, or unpleasant stimuli or conditions;
