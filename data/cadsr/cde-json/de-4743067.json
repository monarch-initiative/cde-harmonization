Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a noninvasive imaging technique that acts as a complement to conventional imaging of brain tumors in order to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic process. This technique operates by exciting and recording signals from a range of magnetic resonance frequencies, allowing the identification and quantification of several biologically significant molecules containing proton groups that resonate in the appropriate frequency range. The technique facilitates observation of the spatial distribution of metabolic patterns over a region of interest and surrounding tissue at a high spatial resolution. Once executed and carried through to completion the date on which an observation was made or an event occurred is reported.","longName":"4743061v1.0:2018550v1.0","context":"PBTC","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"4743061","version":"1","preferredName":"Brain Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging Performed","preferredDefinition":"An organ composed of grey and white matter containing billions of neurons that is the center for intelligence and reasoning.
