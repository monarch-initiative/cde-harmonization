This induces crosslinking of alkylated guanine bases in double-stranded DNA, interferes with both DNA replication and cell division, and results in both the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"693014BC-13F2-F6FE-E040-BB89AD434CC6","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-05-05","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZHANGW","dateCreated":"2009-05-05","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2009-05-05","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2233610","version":"1","preferredName":"Administered","preferredDefinition":"Given.","longName":"C25382","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Administered","conceptCode":"C25382","definition":"The act of having given something (e.g., a medication or test).","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F95D94B9-D864-2792-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-06-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-06-13","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-06-13","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008538","version":"1","preferredName":"Therapies","preferredDefinition":"actions or administration of therapeutic agents to produce an effect that is intended to alter the course of a pathologic process (NCI).","longName":"TX","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B214D04D-9F05-1CA5-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-18","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"NMDP:National Marrow Donor Program","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"693014BC-1400-F6FE-E040-BB89AD434CC6","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-05-05","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZHANGW","dateCreated":"2009-05-05","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":".","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"3988093","version":"1","preferredName":"End Date Known Unknown Indicator","preferredDefinition":"The calendar date on which something is to terminate or did terminate._Recognized, familiar, or within the scope of knowledge._Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused._An event, entity or condition that typically characterizes a prescribed environment or situation and determines or aids in determining whether certain stated circumstances exist or criteria are satisfied.","longName":"3988093v1.0","context":"NHLBI","contextVersion":"1","type":"Enumerated","dataType":"CHARACTER","minLength":null,"maxLength":"60","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[{"value":"Known","valueDescription":"Known","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2934435","version":"1","preferredName":"Known","longName":"2934435","preferredDefinition":"Recognized, familiar, or within the scope of knowledge.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Known","conceptCode":"C80137","definition":"Recognized, familiar, or within the scope of knowledge.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"7181A67F-9F52-BB55-E040-BB89AD432FA8","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-08-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SCOTTLO","dateCreated":"2009-08-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"ED473F69-52B2-A5A3-E040-BB89AD4354E1","beginDate":"2013-12-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2013-12-11","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2013-12-11","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Unknown","valueDescription":"Unknown","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2575365","version":"1","preferredName":"Unknown","longName":"2575365","preferredDefinition":"Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Unknown","conceptCode":"C17998","definition":"Not known, observed, recorded;
