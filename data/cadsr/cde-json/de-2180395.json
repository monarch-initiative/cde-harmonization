Tacrolimus binds to the FKBP-12 protein and forms a complex with calcium-dependent proteins, thereby inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase activity and resulting in decreased cytokine production. This agent exhibits potent immunosuppressive activity in vivo and prevents the activation of T-lymphocytes in response to antigenic or mitogenic stimulation. Tacrolimus possesses similar immunosuppressive properties to cyclosporine, but is more potent.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"54FB5BE0-01E0-7379-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":null,"endDate":null,"createdBy":"ALEYR","dateCreated":"2008-08-21","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"75D25C5E-43C1-BE3B-E040-BB89AD437AF8","beginDate":"2009-10-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2009-10-13","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2009-10-13","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Other","valueDescription":"Other, specify","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2570886","version":"1","preferredName":"Other, specify","longName":"2570886","preferredDefinition":"Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Other","conceptCode":"C17649","definition":"Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-E1F3-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2004-06-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBR","dateCreated":"2004-06-21","modifiedBy":"CAMPBELB","dateModified":"2013-08-30","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"E454D4E2-623B-D0E5-E040-BB89AD433E6E","beginDate":"2013-08-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"WONGW","dateCreated":"2013-08-19","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2013-08-19","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"None","valueDescription":"None","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2577064","version":"1","preferredName":"None","longName":"2577064","preferredDefinition":"No person or thing, nobody, not any.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"None","conceptCode":"C41132","definition":"No person or thing, nobody, not any.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-FA15-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-11-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ALAIS","dateCreated":"2005-11-22","modifiedBy":"TSESU","dateModified":"2023-08-16","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"E454D4E2-6245-D0E5-E040-BB89AD433E6E","beginDate":"2013-08-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"WONGW","dateCreated":"2013-08-19","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2013-08-19","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Sirolimus","valueDescription":"Sirolimus","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2760061","version":"1","preferredName":"Sirolimus","longName":"2760061","preferredDefinition":"A drug used to help prevent rejection of organ and bone marrow transplants by the body.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Sirolimus","conceptCode":"C1212","definition":"A natural macrocyclic lactone produced by the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus, with immunosuppressant properties.
