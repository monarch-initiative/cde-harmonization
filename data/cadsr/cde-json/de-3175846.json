If 2 subjects fall in the same Stratum Group (i.e., 0 in the above example), the first subject will be assigned to Arm A because the current position would be 0 and the 2nd subject would be assigned to Arm B since the current position would be incremented by 1 each time an assignment happens.","longName":"3174737v1.0:2848081v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3174737","version":"1","preferredName":"Randomization Book Entry Study Position Number","preferredDefinition":"The allocation of individuals to groups by chance, especially in order to control the variables in an experiment.:A volume made up of pages fastened along one edge and enclosed between protective covers.
