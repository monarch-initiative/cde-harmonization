The similarity of, and functional analysis of, BRCA2 and BRCA1 proteins, suggests that these proteins function in the same genetic pathway. BRCA1 and BRCA2 have transcriptional activation potential and the two proteins are associated with the activation of double-strand break repair and/or homologous recombination. The two proteins have been shown to coexist and colocalize in a biochemical complex.
