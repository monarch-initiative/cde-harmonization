Two T-cell antigen receptors have been identified, consisting of heterodimeric 40-55 kD Ig-like alpha/beta or gamma/delta integral membrane glycoproteins.  Genes for TCR alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits are assembled during T-cell development by somatic rearrangement of germline gene segments, resembling B-cell Ig genes in their mechanisms of diversity generation and activation of expression.  Alpha/beta heterodimers are found on helper and cytotoxic T-cells and are specific for antigenic peptides presented by MHC gene products.  T-cells expressing gamma/delta heterodimers directly recognize proteins and non-proteinacious phospho-ligands.  T-cell receptors are non-covalently associated with CD3, forming the TCR-CD3 complex.
