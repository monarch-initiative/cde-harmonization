When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F7C5DB4E-AC57-18B5-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-05-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2714885","version":"1","preferredName":"Prior Image Fasting","preferredDefinition":"Earlier in time or order.:Any record of an imaging event whether physical or electronic.:Abstaining from food.","longName":"C25629:C48179:C63663","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Prior","conceptCode":"C25629","definition":"Earlier in time or order.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Image","conceptCode":"C48179","definition":"Any record of an imaging event whether physical or electronic.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Fasting","conceptCode":"C63663","definition":"Abstaining from food.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"41A46FA5-94CD-33D6-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2007-12-19","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2007-12-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2233241","version":"1","preferredName":"Medical Imaging","preferredDefinition":"Events, people, materials and activities uniquely defined by medical imaging.
