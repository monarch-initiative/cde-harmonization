OTHER NAME(S): Amendment NOTE(S): The term \"Amendment\" needs to be disambiguated since it sometimes refers to the amended version of the protocol (study protocol document version) and other times refers to the summary of changes (amendment change summary version) that are applied to a protocol to create a new version of the protocol. A character string that identifies a given collection of content of a document at a point in time. EXAMPLE(S): Could be an integer starting at 1, incrementing by 1, with version number incremented by 1 when a version is replaced, but can also be incremented more often to meet local requirements. NOTE(S): Different versions of same document belong to same document group. Over time, there may be multiple changes to document; allows capture of relationships between changes in instances of document over time; can be new version every time content changes.","longName":"3760594v1.0:3165771v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760594","version":"1","preferredName":"Amendment Change Summary Document Version Number Text","preferredDefinition":"A change in a document made by correction, adding, substituting or omitting a certain part.
