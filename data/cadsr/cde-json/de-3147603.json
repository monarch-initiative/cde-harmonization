A serine protease in seminal plasma, PSA may function in liquefaction of seminal coagulum by (preferential Tyr-X) cleavage of seminal vesicle protein. Kallikrein proteases have diverse functions. Mounting evidence implicates kallikreins in carcinogenesis; some have potential as cancer biomarkers. The serum level of PSA is useful in diagnosis and monitoring of prostatic carcinoma.
