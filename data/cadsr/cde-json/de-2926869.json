Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"6E870863-EB85-131A-E053-F662850A0006","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2018-06-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PATELV","dateCreated":"2018-06-13","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-06-13","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"6E870863-EB9E-131A-E053-F662850A0006","beginDate":"2018-06-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PATELV","dateCreated":"2018-06-13","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-06-13","deletedIndicator":"No"}],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008538","version":"1","preferredName":"Therapies","preferredDefinition":"actions or administration of therapeutic agents to produce an effect that is intended to alter the course of a pathologic process (NCI).","longName":"TX","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B214D04D-9F05-1CA5-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-18","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2234813","version":"1","preferredName":"Type","preferredDefinition":"Type; a subdivision of a particular kind of thing.","longName":"C25284","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Type","conceptCode":"C25284","definition":"Something distinguishable as an identifiable class based on common qualities.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Standard","id":"F970CDF6-F90E-21D3-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-06-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-06-14","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-09-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"705448F8-03DC-8D4D-E040-BB89AD434418","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-08-04","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2009-08-04","modifiedBy":"PATELV","dateModified":"2018-06-13","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ClassificationSchemes":[{"publicId":"4057943","version":"1","longName":"Disease Site","context":"NRG","ClassificationSchemeItems":[{"publicId":"4171060","version":"1","longName":"RTOG-0848","context":"NRG"}]}],"AlternateNames":[{"name":"2013308v3.0:2926867v1.0","type":"USED_BY","context":"NRG"},{"name":"AGENT_ADMIN_TYPE","type":"Context Short Name","context":"NRG"}],"ReferenceDocuments":[{"name":"Which drug will be administer","type":"Preferred Question Text","description":"Which drug will be administered","url":null,"context":"CTEP"},{"name":"CRF Text 2","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"Drug administered","url":null,"context":"CTEP"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"705448F8-0405-8D4D-E040-BB89AD434418","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-08-04","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2009-08-04","modifiedBy":"KRYSTKIA","dateModified":"2016-10-20","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
