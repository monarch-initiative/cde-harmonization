{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3761189","version":"1","preferredName":"Negation Study Subject Administration, Management Performed Study Activity Date and Time Range ISO21090.IVL.TS.DATETIME.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"The completed study level administrative activity that is independent of a study subject. EXAMPLE(S): IRB Approval, site enrollment, FDA audit The date and time span when this activity began and ended. EXAMPLE(S): (1) Date and time when sample is taken from subject. (2) Chemotherapy dose given on June 12th starting 9am, finishing 12pm. NOTE(S): (1) Whether administrative or preparatory activities are included in this time frame is up to whoever is defining the activity - this time frame is all that matters when the activity occurred. (2) Date range is an interval data type, i.e. has a beginning (low) and end (high) values; is also TS.DATETIME data type, i.e. dates can have uncertain values (e.g., a range). So, if subject was diagnosed w/ leukemia sometime in 2009 and had transplant (substance administration) sometime in 2010, can surmise subject had preparative regimen between those times. I.e. preparative regimen would have beginning (low) date range of between 2009-01-01 and 2009-12-31; and ending (high) date range of between 2010-01-01 and 2010-12-31: IVL<TS.DATETIME>.low.uncertainRange.low = 2009-01-01, IVL<TS.DATETIME>.low.uncertainRange.high = 2009-12-31, IVL<TS.DATETIME>.high.uncertainRange.low = 2010-01-01, IVL<TS.DATETIME>.high.uncertainRange.high = 2010-12-31; [times left out to keep it
