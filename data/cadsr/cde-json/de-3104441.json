Ligand binding increases phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. A potential heterodimer with ERBB3 and ERBB4 receptors, p185ERBB2 is an essential component of the heregulin/neuregulin receptor complex. ERBB2 homodimers do not bind heregulin but ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers do. Neuregulins do not interact with ERBB2 alone. The IL6 cytokine induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ERBB2 and ERBB3, but not EGFR. ERBB2 forms an IL6-dependent complex with the IL6R gp130 subunit resulting in MAPK activation. Expressed in fetal kidney and liver, herstatin is a 68 kD secreted product of an alternative ERBB2 transcript that retains intron 8. Herstatin binds p185ERBB2 as an inhibitor by disrupting ERBB2 dimers and reducing p185 tyrosine phosphorylation.
