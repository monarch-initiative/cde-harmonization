NOTE(S): Relationships with lower priority number values are considered before and above those with higher values. The ordering may be a total ordering, in which all priority number are unique, or a partial ordering, in which the same priority may be assigned to more than one relationship. Decimal numbers may be used to insert values between existing priority numbers. For multiple criteria, this specifies which criteria are considered before others.
