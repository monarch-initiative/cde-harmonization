Although this term may be used to describe any therapy involving the use of chemical-based agents, it is most commonly used to refer to the variety of chemical-based agents employed to treat cancer.  Cancer chemotherapy works by arresting or killing the growth and spread of cancer cells.  Because cancer cells usually divide much faster than normal cells, they are often very sensitive to the inhibitory actions of chemotherapeutic agents.  Chemotherapy may also include agents that enhance immune function or alter hormonal activity.
