The widespread use of mammography has contributed in the detection of very early cancerous lesions (less than 2mm in diameter).

The most common site of lymph node involvment is the axilla.  Breast carcinomas infrequently occur in males (particularly elderly individuals and patients with Klinefelter's syndrome).
