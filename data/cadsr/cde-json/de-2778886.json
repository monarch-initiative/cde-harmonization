The protein found on the surface of some cells and to which epidermal growth factor binds, causing the cells to divide. It is found at abnormally high levels on the surface of many types of cancer cells, so these cells may divide excessively in the presence of epidermal growth factor.:The ERBB2 gene encodes a putative tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor EGFR2, p185 HER2/NEU antigen, similar to the EGF receptor.  The ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 genes encode heregulin/neuregulin receptors, members of the EGFR-related type I receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily.  The encoded proteins form homo- and heterodimers, which complicates assignment of function: ERBB2 homodimers do not bind heregulin, but ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers do.  Herstatin is a secreted alternative ERBB2 product, of the extracellular domain, that binds to p185ERBB2, disrupts ERBB2 dimers, reduces p185 phosphorylation, and inhibits growth.  Human ERBB2 gene is located at 17p12-21.
