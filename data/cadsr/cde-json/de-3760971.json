A character string that identifies a given collection of content of a document at a point in time. EXAMPLE(S): Could be an integer starting at 1, incrementing by 1, with version number incremented by 1 when a version is replaced, but can also be incremented more often to meet local requirements. NOTE(S): Different versions of same document belong to same document group. Over time, there may be multiple changes to document; allows capture of relationships between changes in instances of document over time; can be new version every time content changes.","longName":"3760194v1.0:3165771v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760194","version":"1","preferredName":"Study Subject Clinical Trial Experience Document Version Number Text","preferredDefinition":"A matter or an individual that is observed, analyzed, examined, investigated, experimented upon, or/and treated in the course of a particular study.:A research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes.
