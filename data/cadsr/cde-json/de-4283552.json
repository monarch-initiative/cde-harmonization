Alendronic acid binds to and inhibits the activity of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, an enzyme involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids, donor substrates of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation during the post-translational modification of small GTPase signalling proteins, which are important in the process of osteoclast turnover. As a result, bone resorption and turnover are reduced.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F224FB27-D6A5-DD58-E040-BB89AD437691","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2014-02-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"BASSG","dateCreated":"2014-02-11","modifiedBy":"KUMMEROA","dateModified":"2023-04-12","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"F834A2E0-E6CB-938A-E040-BB89AD431A2F","beginDate":"2014-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"BRETTS","dateCreated":"2014-04-29","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2014-04-29","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Abraxane","valueDescription":"Abraxane","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"4147719","version":"1","preferredName":"Abraxane","longName":"4147719","preferredDefinition":"Abraxane","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F224FB27-D6C8-DD58-E040-BB89AD437691","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2014-02-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"BASSG","dateCreated":"2014-02-11","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"F834A2E0-E6D5-938A-E040-BB89AD431A2F","beginDate":"2014-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"BRETTS","dateCreated":"2014-04-29","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2014-04-29","deletedIndicator":"No"}],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008538","version":"1","preferredName":"Therapies","preferredDefinition":"actions or administration of therapeutic agents to produce an effect that is intended to alter the course of a pathologic process (NCI).","longName":"TX","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B214D04D-9F05-1CA5-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-18","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2229718","version":"1","preferredName":"Name","preferredDefinition":"The words or language units by which a thing is known.","longName":"C42614","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Name","conceptCode":"C42614","definition":"The words or language units by which a thing is known.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Standard","id":"F6EF4E2B-76AE-72C1-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2005-05-16","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-16","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F834A2E0-E599-938A-E040-BB89AD431A2F","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2014-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"BRETTS","dateCreated":"2014-04-29","modifiedBy":"BRETTS","dateModified":"2015-07-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ClassificationSchemes":[],"AlternateNames":[],"ReferenceDocuments":[{"name":"Treatment Name","type":"Preferred Question Text","description":"Treatment Name","url":null,"context":"NRG"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F834A2E0-E6DF-938A-E040-BB89AD431A2F","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2014-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"BRETTS","dateCreated":"2014-04-29","modifiedBy":"BRETTS","dateModified":"2015-07-10","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
