potential cell-protective and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon intravenous administration of recombinant human IL-2 mutein/Fc fusion protein AMG 592, the IL-2 mutein moiety binds to its receptors, and activates IL-2-mediated signaling pathways. IL-2 mutein preferentially expands and activates regulatory T-cells (Tregs), thereby preventing inadequate immune responses and restoring immune homeostasis. This may help control or prevent inflammatory reactions as seen in inflammatory-based diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). IL-2 mutein is less able to stimulate natural killer (NK) cells and conventional T-cells, which may lead to reduced toxicity compared to treatment with recombinant IL-2. Fusion to the Fc increases the stability and half-life of AMG 592.
