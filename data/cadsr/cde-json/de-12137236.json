The genetic material as 'naked' DNA can be delivered into the cells alone or can be delivered into cells by different types of vectors such as viruses which may contain DNA or RNA.  Gene therapy techniques attempt to replace a faulty/missing gene associated with a particular disease, mediate localized delivery of a protein producing specified therapeutic effects, or introduce new cellular functions.  Gene therapies are designed to deliver genetic material into somatic cells and not germ cells, so that only cells of patients and not those of their offspring contain and express the genetic material delivered.
