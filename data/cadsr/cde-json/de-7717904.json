The effects of mutation range from single base changes to loss or gain of complete chromosomes. As many of the simpler alterations to DNA may be repaired, such changes are only heritable once the change is fixed in the DNA by the process of replication. Mutations may be associated with genetic diversity or with pathologies including cancer.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"9FE256E1-8EE0-7CEE-E040-BB89AD4307FD","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-04-01","endDate":null,"createdBy":"WHITES","dateCreated":"2011-04-01","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2011-04-01","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2239981","version":"1","preferredName":"Diagnosis","preferredDefinition":"The process of identifying a disease by the signs and symptoms.","longName":"C15220","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Diagnosis","conceptCode":"C15220","definition":"The investigation, analysis and recognition of the presence and nature of disease, condition, or injury from expressed signs and symptoms;
