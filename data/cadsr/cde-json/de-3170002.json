(American Heritage Dictionary):(AN-tih-BOD-ee) A type of protein made by certain white blood cells in response to a foreign substance (antigen). Each antibody can bind to only a specific antigen. The purpose of this binding is to help destroy the antigen. Antibodies can work in several ways, depending on the nature of the antigen. Some antibodies destroy antigens directly. Others make it easier for white blood cells to destroy the antigen.","longName":"C25251:C16295","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Primary","conceptCode":"C25251","definition":"Occurring first in time or sequence; original; of greatest rank or importance or value.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Antibody","conceptCode":"C16295","definition":"A type of protein made by B lymphocytes in response to a foreign substance (antigen).
