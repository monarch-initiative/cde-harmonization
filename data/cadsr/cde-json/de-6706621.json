Inherited coagulation factor-deficient hemophilias include hemophilia A or classic hemophilia (hereditary factor VIII deficiency) hemophilia B or Christmas disease (hereditary factor IX deficiency), and hemophilia C (hereditary factor XI deficiency). Factor VIII inhibitors may occur spontaneously as autoantibodies, resulting in acquired hemophilia known as acquired factor VIII deficiency.
