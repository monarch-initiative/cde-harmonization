In addition to predicting distant disease recurrence, Oncotype DX also assesses the benefit from certain types of chemotherapy. The assay, performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, analyzes the expression of a panel of 21 genes and the results are provided as a Recurrence Score (0-100). The gene panel was selected and the Recurrence Score calculation was derived through extensive laboratory testing and multiple independent clinical development studies. Oncotype DX is validated for use in breast cancer patients whose disease is newly diagnosed, stage I or II, node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive and who will be treated with tamoxifen. (from genomichealth.com):The ERBB2 Gene at 17q21.1 encodes ERRB2 Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase, a 185 kD type I membrane glycoprotein that controls cell growth with features similar to EGFR. Ligand binding increases phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. A potential heterodimer with ERBB3 and ERBB4 receptors, p185ERBB2 is an essential component of the heregulin/neuregulin receptor complex. ERBB2 homodimers do not bind heregulin but ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers do. Neuregulins do not interact with ERBB2 alone. The IL6 cytokine induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ERBB2 and ERBB3, but not EGFR. ERBB2 forms an IL6-dependent complex with the IL6R gp130 subunit resulting in MAPK activation. Expressed in fetal kidney and liver, herstatin is a 68 kD secreted product of an alternative ERBB2 transcript that retains intron 8. Herstatin binds p185ERBB2 as an inhibitor by disrupting ERBB2 dimers and reducing p185 tyrosine phosphorylation.  (from SWISS-PROT, OMIM and NCI):Outcome; a phenomenon that follows and is caused by some previous phenomenon.","longName":"C52159:C17756:C20200","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay","conceptCode":"C52159","definition":"A diagnostic assay that quantifies the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence in women with newly diagnosed, early stage breast cancer.
