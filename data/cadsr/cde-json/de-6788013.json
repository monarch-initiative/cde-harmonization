Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"ACAAECCE-7A0E-657B-E034-0003BA0B1A09","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-10-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2002-10-29","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-03-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2177321","version":"1","preferredName":"Use","preferredDefinition":"Use;
