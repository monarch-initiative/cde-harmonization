This subtest evaluates the respondents' ability to identify sight words. The PDE subtest involves presenting a list of printed nonwords. The respondent must accurately decode and pronounce as many words as possible in 45 seconds. This subtest evaluates the respondents' ability to decode ('sound out') nonwords.
