CD3D, CD3G and CD3E are transmembrane proteins with one extracellular immunoglobulin domain and one intracellular ITAM domain. The CD3 complex is a T-cell co-receptor that noncovalently associates with either the disulfide bound heterodimeric alpha/beta T-cell receptor (TCR) or gamma/delta TCR and two copies of the accessory protein, T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 zeta chain (CD247), which is a transmembrane protein with three ITAM domains. The TCR moiety of the TCR-CD3 complex binds to MHC and processed antigens on antigen presenting cells, which triggers phosphorylation of and cellular propagation of the signal by CD247 and the CD3 complex.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"C64D85C5-7557-4BF3-E040-BB89AD4309F1","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2012-08-02","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-08-02","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"EED81878-CC3F-AC81-E040-BB89AD430A03","beginDate":"2013-12-31","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2013-12-31","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2013-12-31","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"CD2","valueDescription":"T-Cell Surface Antigen CD2","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"4038017","version":"1","preferredName":"T-Cell Surface Antigen CD2","longName":"4038017","preferredDefinition":"T-cell surface antigen CD2 (351 aa, 39 kD) is a cell fate protein that is encoded by the human CD2 gene and has a role in induction of apoptosis.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"T-Cell Surface Antigen CD2","conceptCode":"C15174","definition":"T-cell surface antigen CD2 (351 aa, ~39 kDa) is encoded by the human CD2 gene.
