EXAMPLE(S): For regular submissions the code can be: approved, not approvable, approvable, complete response or cleared. For expanded access submissions the code can be: Available, No longer available, Temporarily not available, or Approved for marketing. NOTE(S): For some submissions, there are business processes that will make \"default\" action based on timelines --i.e., if no action is taken, then the submission is \"approved\". For a submission, there may be multiple regulatory assessments that correspond to the state transitions for a submission, but only one regulatory assessment is true at a given time. A submission can first be \"approvable\" and then when the data is complete, a new regulatory assessment can be made that is \"approved\".","longName":"3174862v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3174862","version":"1","preferredName":"Regulation Assessment Code","preferredDefinition":"A rule or order issued by an authority stating what may or may not be done or how something must be done.:The final result of a determination of the value, significance, or extent of._A system of numbered categories for representation of data.","longName":"3174220v1.0:2222855v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","ObjectClass":{"publicId":"3174220","version":"1","preferredName":"Regulation Assessment","preferredDefinition":"A rule or order issued by an authority stating what may or may not be done or how something must be done.:The final result of a determination of the value, significance, or extent of.","longName":"C68821:C25217","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Regulation","conceptCode":"C68821","definition":"A rule or order issued by an authority stating what may or may not be done or how something must be done.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Assessment","conceptCode":"C25217","definition":"The final result of a determination of the value, significance, or extent of.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"97F2784D-C1E6-86BB-E040-BB89AD4319ED","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-12-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_BRIDGPRD","dateCreated":"2010-12-21","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-12-21","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2222855","version":"1","preferredName":"Code","preferredDefinition":"A system of numbered categories for representation of data.","longName":"C25162","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Code","conceptCode":"C25162","definition":"A symbol or combination of symbols which is assigned to the members of a collection.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F621162F-5C48-4F85-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-02","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_EVS","dateCreated":"2005-05-02","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2222502","version":"1","preferredName":"UML DEFAULT CD","preferredDefinition":"Default Conceptual Domain for UML Loader","longName":"UML DEFAULT CD","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F5E53F3B-47A4-52D1-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2005-04-29","modifiedBy":"DWARZEL","dateModified":"2021-04-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"97F33F8A-CB92-9272-E040-BB89AD43201B","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-12-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_BRIDGPRD","dateCreated":"2010-12-21","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":"DEC released per model owner approval. mc 2/2/11","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2803170","version":"1","preferredName":"ISO21090.CD.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"Reference concept defined by a referenced code system.","longName":"2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"ISO21090CDv1.0","minLength":null,"maxLength":null,"minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2846956","version":"1","preferredName":"ISO21090 Data Types","preferredDefinition":"Health Informatics -
