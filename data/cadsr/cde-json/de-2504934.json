{"DataElement":{"publicId":"2504934","version":"1","preferredName":"Gene Annotation Status Flag Indicator","preferredDefinition":"A functional unit of heredity which occupies a specific position (locus) on a particular chromosome, is capable of reproducing itself exactly at each cell division, and directs the formation of an enzyme or other protein. The gene as a functional unit consists of a discrete segment of a giant DNA molecule containing the purine (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidine (cytosine and thymine) bases in the ordered and correct sequence that encodes a specific functional product (i.e., a protein or RNA molecule). Protein synthesis is mediated by molecules of messenger-RNA formed on the chromosome with the gene acting as template. The RNA then passes into the cytoplasm and becomes oriented on the ribosomes where it in turn acts as template to organize a chain of amino acids to form a peptide. Genes normally occur in pairs in all cells except gametes, as a consequence of the fact that all chromosomes are paired except the sex chromosomes (X and Y) of the male._An explanatory or critical comment that has been added to a text._A condition or state at a particular time._An indicator that can be set or unset in order to signal whether a particular condition is true. The indicator usually takes the form of a single binary digit, or bit (either 0 or 1). (from Dictionary of Computers)._An event, entity or condition that typically characterizes a prescribed environment or situation. Indicators determine or aid in determining whether or not certain stated circumstances exist or criteria are satisfied.
