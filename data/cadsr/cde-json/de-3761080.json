A character string that identifies a given collection of content of a document at a point in time. EXAMPLE(S): Could be an integer starting at 1, incrementing by 1, with version number incremented by 1 when a version is replaced, but can also be incremented more often to meet local requirements. NOTE(S): Different versions of same document belong to same document group. Over time, there may be multiple changes to document; allows capture of relationships between changes in instances of document over time; can be new version every time content changes.","longName":"3760297v1.0:3165771v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760297","version":"1","preferredName":"Statistics Analysis Plan Document Version Number Text","preferredDefinition":"A branch of applied mathematics concerned with the collection and interpretation of quantitative data and the use of probability theory to estimate population parameters.:Examination and interpretation; the process of identifying an issue to be understood and addressed, modelling the issue, investigating the model results, interpreting the results, and possibly making a recommendation.
