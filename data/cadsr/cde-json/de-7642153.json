Less than 1 % of neoplasms are associated with these syndromes. An immune-mediated response to neoplasm-elaborated proteins may be the cause of these syndromes. Additionally, their manifestation may signal the presence of an occult neoplasm, potentially at an earlier stage of disease thereby leading to a better clinical outcome. Constitutional signs may include fever, night sweats, anorexia and cachexia. Clinical course is usually progressive. Prognosis is variable depending on the effective treatment of the underlying neoplasm.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"C09370E4-A008-1530-E053-4EBD850A461A","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2021-04-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KNABLEJ","dateCreated":"2021-04-22","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2021-04-22","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2233878","version":"1","preferredName":"Present","preferredDefinition":"Being or existing in a specified place or at the specified time.","longName":"C25626","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Present","conceptCode":"C25626","definition":"Being or existing in a specified place or at the specified time.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F970CDF6-F829-21D3-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-06-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-06-14","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-06-14","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008571","version":"1","preferredName":"Chronic or Associated Diseases and Exposures","preferredDefinition":"chronic diseases, as well as diseases and exposures associated with cancer.","longName":"CHR_O_ASS_DZ_AND_EXP","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B9B9249B-AB81-2F8D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-03-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-03-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"CPTAC: Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Qualified","id":"C09370E4-A016-1530-E053-4EBD850A461A","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2021-04-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KNABLEJ","dateCreated":"2021-04-22","modifiedBy":"COLBERTM","dateModified":"2022-06-06","changeDescription":"4/22/21 jk created for HNSCC Baseline CRF.","administrativeNotes":"6/6/22 mr  Released and RS updated to Qualified per CPTAC/Nicolletteâ€™s XLS review as part of quarterly metrics review.","unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"6784451","version":"1","preferredName":"255 Character Text","preferredDefinition":"The words of something written.","longName":"6784451v1.0","context":"OCCPR","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"CHARACTER","minLength":null,"maxLength":"255","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008551","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessments","preferredDefinition":"evaluations of the patient and the patient's disease.","longName":"ASSESS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B22DA727-6718-5A2D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2234203","version":"1","preferredName":"Text","preferredDefinition":"Text;
