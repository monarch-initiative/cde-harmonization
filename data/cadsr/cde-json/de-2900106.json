It is the most common malignant tumor in females. Risk factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens, contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation. The vast majority of breast carcinomas are adenocarcinomas (ductal or lobular). Breast carcinoma spreads by direct invasion, by the lymphatic route, and by the blood vessel route. The most common site of lymph node involvement is the axilla.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"4"},{"longName":"Computer","conceptCode":"C16464","definition":"A machine for performing calculations automatically.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"3"},{"longName":"Analysis","conceptCode":"C25391","definition":"Examination and interpretation; the process of identifying an issue to be understood and addressed, modelling the issue, investigating the model results, interpreting the results, and possibly making a recommendation.
