Selenium primarily occurs in vivo as selenocompounds, mostly selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase (enzymes responsible for detoxification). Alone or in combination with Vitamin E, selenocompounds act as antioxidants. These agents scavenge free radicals; prevent blood clots by inhibiting platelet aggregation; strengthen the immune system; and have been shown, in some instances, to inhibit chromosomal damage and mutations. Exhibiting chemopreventive activity, selenocompounds also inhibit the induction of protein kinase C.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Level","conceptCode":"C25554","definition":"A position on a scale measuring intensity, quality, or amount.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"74A7B5CB-AD3D-0989-E040-BB89AD435EB0","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-09-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2009-09-28","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2009-09-28","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008551","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessments","preferredDefinition":"evaluations of the patient and the patient's disease.","longName":"ASSESS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B22DA727-6718-5A2D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"NHANES:National Health Examination Survey, CDC","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"74A7B5CB-AD4E-0989-E040-BB89AD435EB0","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-09-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2009-09-28","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":" Changed from caBIG to PhenX for PANH by script 2015-12-21","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2182118","version":"1","preferredName":"Number","preferredDefinition":"A numeral or string of numerals expressing value, quantity, or identification.","longName":"NUMBER","context":"CCR","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"NUMBER","minLength":"0","maxLength":"5","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":"0","PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008541","version":"1","preferredName":"Numbers","preferredDefinition":"the set of non-negative integers.","longName":"NUMS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B227CE66-2830-4A7B-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2233101","version":"1","preferredName":"Number","preferredDefinition":"Number;
