Although this term may be used to describe any therapy involving the use of chemical-based agents, it is most commonly used to refer to the variety of chemical-based agents employed to treat cancer.  Cancer chemotherapy works by arresting or killing the growth and spread of cancer cells.  Because cancer cells usually divide much faster than normal cells, they are often very sensitive to the inhibitory actions of chemotherapeutic agents.  Chemotherapy may also include agents that enhance immune function or alter hormonal activity. (NCI04)_A modified dipeptidyl boronic acid with antineoplastic activity. Via boronic acid moiety, bortezomib reversibly binds to the 26S proteasome, where degradation of ubiquinated proteins occurs. By blocking the targeted proteolysis normally performed by the proteasome, bortezomib disrupts various cell signaling pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis.  Specifically, the agent inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a protein that is constitutively activated in some cancers, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB-mediated cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. In vivo, bortezomib delays tumor growth and enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy._Generic value domain for a primitive java datatype that is a Boolean value (true or false).","longName":"2752116v1.0:2178538v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"2752116","version":"1","preferredName":"Chemotherapy Bortezomib","preferredDefinition":"The use of synthetic or naturally-occurring chemicals for the treatment of diseases.
