Fluorouracil is an antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the nucleoside pyrimidine with antineoplastic activity.  Fluorouracil and its metabolites possess a number of different mechanisms of action.  In vivo, fluoruracil is converted to the active metabolite 5-fluoroxyuridine monophosphate (F-UMP); replacing uracil, F-UMP incorporates into RNA and inhibits RNA processing, thereby inhibiting cell growth.  Another active metabolite, 5-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP), inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), a necessary constituent of DNA.  Other fluorouracil metabolites incorporate into both RNA and DNA; incorporation into RNA results in major effects on both the processing and functions of RNA.","longName":"FLUOROURACIL","context":"Alliance","contextVersion":"1","ObjectClass":{"publicId":"2718486","version":"1","preferredName":"Neoadjuvant Therapy","preferredDefinition":"Treatment designed to be used as a first step toward shrinking the cancer and in evaluating response to drugs and other agents.
