During TCR engagement with MHC-associated antigen on host cell surfaces and synapse formation, CD3 activity leads to Tyr-phosphorylated CD3 subunits, Tyr phosphorylation of LAT colocalized in lipid rafts, and MAPK activation. CD3 signal transduction appears to involve LCK, ZAP70, Nck, SLA, SLA2, and DOCK2. CD3 subunits may also associate with the cytoskeleton. CD3 also mediates TCR signal transduction during the developmental transition through positive selection of immature thymocytes to mature CD4+ or CD8+ T cells.
