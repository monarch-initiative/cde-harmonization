Although this term may be used to describe any therapy involving the use of chemical-based agents, it is most commonly used to refer to the variety of chemical-based agents employed to treat cancer.  Cancer chemotherapy works by arresting or killing the growth and spread of cancer cells.  Because cancer cells usually divide much faster than normal cells, they are often very sensitive to the inhibitory actions of chemotherapeutic agents.  Chemotherapy may also include agents that enhance immune function or alter hormonal activity.

Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Plan","conceptCode":"C25619","definition":"To devise, contrive, or form in design.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Administration","conceptCode":"C25409","definition":"The act of the dispensing, applying, or tendering of something to another, such as administration of a medicine.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"4C7D0BAB-AE44-582F-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-05-05","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2008-05-05","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-05-05","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008538","version":"1","preferredName":"Therapies","preferredDefinition":"actions or administration of therapeutic agents to produce an effect that is intended to alter the course of a pathologic process (NCI).","longName":"TX","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B214D04D-9F05-1CA5-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-18","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"4C7D0BAB-AE55-582F-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-05-05","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2008-05-05","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2551949","version":"1","preferredName":"Regimen Type","preferredDefinition":"the type or kind of therapuetic regimen.","longName":"REGM_TP","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","type":"Enumerated","dataType":"CHARACTER","minLength":null,"maxLength":"25","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[{"value":"Dose dense","valueDescription":"Dose dense","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2582378","version":"1","preferredName":"Dose dense","longName":"2582378","preferredDefinition":"Dose dense","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE88-0ED7-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-12-08","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2006-12-08","modifiedBy":"CAMPBELB","dateModified":"2006-12-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"2419F36B-B0AA-49D6-E044-0003BA3F9857","beginDate":"2006-12-08","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2006-12-08","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-12-08","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Classical","valueDescription":"Classical","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2578693","version":"1","preferredName":"Classical","longName":"2578693","preferredDefinition":"Classical","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE88-0072-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-04-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2006-04-20","modifiedBy":"SHIDED","dateModified":"2006-04-20","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"2419F36B-B098-49D6-E044-0003BA3F9857","beginDate":"2006-12-08","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2006-12-08","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-12-08","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Classical -
