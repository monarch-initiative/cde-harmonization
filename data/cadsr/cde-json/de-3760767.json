EXAMPLE(S): A report initiated by the primary physician may be ranked higher than reports initiated by specialty consultants or support staff. NOTE(S): Relationships with lower priority number values are considered before and above those with higher values. There may be multiple investigations (and therefore reports) into the same event, each initiated by a different party. The priority number may be used to rank these investigations. The ordering may be a total ordering, in which all priority numbers are unique, or a partial ordering, in which the same priority may be assigned to more than one relationship. Decimal numbers may be used to insert values between existing priority numbers.","longName":"3759993v1.0:2803201v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3759993","version":"1","preferredName":"Document Version Relationship Priority Number","preferredDefinition":"An organized collection of records that describe a particular body of work.:A form or variant of a type or original;
