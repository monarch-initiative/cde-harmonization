Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"3"},{"longName":"Total","conceptCode":"C25304","definition":"Pertaining to an entirety or whole, also constituting the full quantity or extent; complete; derived by addition.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Quantity","conceptCode":"C25256","definition":"How much there is of something that you can measure; the total amount or number.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria","conceptCode":"C16112","definition":"Characteristics which are necessary to allow a subject to participate in a clinical study, as outlined in the study protocol.
