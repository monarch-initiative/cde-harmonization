Representative examples include Laboratory (LB), Subject Characteristics (SC), and Trial Summary (TS)._One of a set of ordered partitions of an experimental unit's participation in a study. An Epoch represents a state within a study such that subjects in separate arms within that state are comparable. Each epoch serves a purpose in the trial as a whole, typically exposing the subject to a treatment or preparing them for a treatment, or gathering post-treatment data. Activities and activity results control the subject's movement from one epoch to another. EXAMPLE(S): A study designed to assess the effects of treatments might have 3 epochs. A Screening Epoch in which subjects' eligibility is determined and baseline measurements are made. A Treatment Epoch during which treatments are given and effects of treatment are assessed. A Follow-up Epoch during which post-treatment assessments are conducted. NOTE(S): A subject moves from one epoch to another and can only be in one epoch at a time. The subject can only move to an epoch with a greater sequenceNumber. Activities in the same epoch but a different arm need not be similar in time and pattern. Subjects in different arms will not necessarily pass through the same epochs.","longName":"6409461v1.0:6385471v1.0","context":"NCI Standards","contextVersion":"1","ObjectClass":{"publicId":"6409461","version":"1","preferredName":"CDISC Domain","preferredDefinition":"A collection of data variables or metadata for use with a Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) data submission.
