Examples of these devices include Hickman catheters, which require clamps to make sure the valve is closed, and Groshong catheters, which have a valve that opens as fluid is withdrawn or infused and remains closed when not in use.:Medical device - any machinery designed to aid diagnostic and medical therapies. Medical device has to be designed with rigorous safety standards. There are several basic types of medical devices: life support equipment used to maintain a patient's body functions; therapeutic equipment; monitors and detectors to measure the indexes of a patient's state; imagine machines and laboratory equipment used with diagnostic and status monitoring purposes. In insurance parlance, the term is usually synonymous with assistive device, although it may include medical supplies.","longName":"C17612:C16830","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Central Venous Access Catheter","conceptCode":"C17612","definition":"A venous catheter positioned with the tip in the proximal third of the superior vena cava, the right atrium, or the inferior vena cava.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Medical Device","conceptCode":"C16830","definition":"Any physical object that is useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"3BAE9246-4A8A-1C30-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-10-04","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2007-10-04","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2007-10-04","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2637263","version":"1","preferredName":"Removed","preferredDefinition":"Removed;
