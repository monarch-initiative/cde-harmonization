It is designed to be administered in conjunction with, or as follow-up to, speech sound testing. Atypical observations may be used to identify the cause of speech disorders. For instance, deficits in neuromuscular functions during this protocol could confirm dysarthria, and deficits in motor planning could confirm apraxia of speech. The orofacial measures include observations of the structures and functionality of the facial muscles, lips, tongue, and jaw. Some speech productions are also assessed, but note that this protocol does not evaluate speech sound production systematically. Instead, other protocols such as the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation 3 are designed to assess speech sound production. If abnormal structure or function is observed, closer examination by a clinician or specialist is required.","url":null,"context":"PhenX"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Standard","id":"8A6AA653-EF2F-6D14-E053-F662850A1439","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2019-06-03","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2019-06-03","modifiedBy":"ZHWENDY","dateModified":"2022-07-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":"7/19/2022: fixed the box symbol in PQT.wz","unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
