Glandular or tubular structures are absent.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"With","conceptCode":"C62355","definition":"Used to indicate the presence of something or someone.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Lymphocytic Infiltrate","conceptCode":"C35983","definition":"A morphologic finding referring to the presence of a cellular infiltrate that is composed of non-neoplastic or neoplastic lymphocytes in a tissue sample.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"089FFF8F-3025-A98D-E050-BB89AD436F4C","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2014-11-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZIEGLERK","dateCreated":"2014-11-24","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"089FFF8F-303E-A98D-E050-BB89AD436F4C","beginDate":"2014-11-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZIEGLERK","dateCreated":"2014-11-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2014-11-24","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Inflammatory","valueDescription":"INFLAMMATORY","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2558968","version":"1","preferredName":"INFLAMMATORY","longName":"2558968","preferredDefinition":"INFLAMMATORY","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Inflammatory","conceptCode":"C25535","definition":"Relating to inflammation.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-B365-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-02-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBR","dateCreated":"2002-02-13","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"089FFF8F-3048-A98D-E050-BB89AD436F4C","beginDate":"2014-11-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZIEGLERK","dateCreated":"2014-11-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2014-11-24","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Mammary","valueDescription":"Mammary","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2575125","version":"1","preferredName":"Mammary","longName":"2575125","preferredDefinition":"Mammary","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-F282-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2005-05-24","modifiedBy":"REEVESD","dateModified":"2005-05-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"5BAE6E65-1D4A-78CA-E053-F662850A8DE1","beginDate":"2017-10-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MORENOC","dateCreated":"2017-10-16","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2017-10-16","deletedIndicator":"No"}],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008537","version":"1","preferredName":"Diagnosis","preferredDefinition":"the process of identifying a disease by the signs and symptoms (NCI Glossary).","longName":"DX","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B205508C-8324-69B0-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-17","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-17","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2208105","version":"1","preferredName":"Histologic Category","preferredDefinition":"Of or relating to histology.:Category;
