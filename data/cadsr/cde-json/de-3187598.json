Adenocarcinoma is the most common carcinoma in the colon and rectum. Colorectal adenocarcinoma can be divided in three grades: Grade I (low grade or well-differentiated), grade II (average grade or moderately differentiated) and grade III (poorly differentiated). The following histopathologic features have been shown to be prognostic indicators in multivariate analysis: microacinar versus macroacinar growth pattern, endocrine cells detected by chromogranin immunohistochemistry, Crohn's-like reaction and tumor budding. The standard therapy for colorectal carcinoma is surgical resection.
