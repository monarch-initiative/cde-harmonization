CMPDs are primarily diseases of adults._Permanent, transmissible changes in the genetic material of an organism. Mutations can range from a single base change to the loss of a significant portion of a chromosome. These occur when DNA is not repaired prior to replication. Mutations in germ cells can be inherited. However, in somatic cells, they are not inherited. Somatic mutations can arise via exposure to chemical mutagens or ionizing radiation. These fixed changes in the genetic material can, in some cases, lead to cancer or other diseases._A test result that indicates that a specific disease, condition, or attribute being assessed is present._This gene is involved in erythropoiesis and signal transduction.","longName":"MPS_MTN_POS_JAK2","context":"NHLBI","contextVersion":"1","ObjectClass":{"publicId":"2674375","version":"1","preferredName":"Chronic Myeloproliferative Disorder","preferredDefinition":"Chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders, characterized by proliferation in the bone marrow of one or more of the myeloid (i.e., granulocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic) lineages.
