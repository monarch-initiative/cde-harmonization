Scans often used in diagnosing, staging, and monitoring disease include liver scans, bone scans, and computed tomography (CT) or computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. In liver scanning and bone scanning, radioactive substances that are injected into the bloodstream collect in these organs. A scanner that detects the radiation is used to create pictures. In CT scanning, an x-ray machine linked to a computer is used to produce detailed pictures of organs inside the body. MRI scans use a large magnet connected to a computer to create pictures of areas inside the body.","longName":"C71894:C17999","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Emission","conceptCode":"C71894","definition":"A substance that is emitted or released.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Scan","conceptCode":"C17999","definition":"The data or image obtained by gathering information with a sensing device.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"459B6193-A8E3-0231-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-02-07","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2008-02-07","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-02-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2727628","version":"1","preferredName":"Bed Position","preferredDefinition":"No Value Exists:Position; the particular portion of space occupied by a physical object.","longName":"C50367:C25339","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Bed","conceptCode":"C50367","definition":"A structure that permits a subject to recline; it can be used for sleeping or for positioning a subject for a procedure.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Position","conceptCode":"C25339","definition":"Position; the particular portion of space occupied by a physical object.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"457DCC4D-1F0B-050E-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-02-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2008-02-06","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-02-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2233241","version":"1","preferredName":"Medical Imaging","preferredDefinition":"Events, people, materials and activities uniquely defined by medical imaging.
