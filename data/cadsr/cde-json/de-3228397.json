Leukemia is usually associated with anemia, fever, hemorrhagic episodes, and splenomegaly. Common leukemias include acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment is vital to patient survival; untreated, the natural course of acute leukemias is normally measured in weeks or months, while that of chronic leukemias is more often measured in months or years.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Status","conceptCode":"C25688","definition":"A condition or state at a particular time.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"A16046E6-D77B-1B8D-E040-BB89AD434ADA","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-04-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2011-04-20","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2011-04-20","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FF82234F-5D1E-5ED8-E040-BB89AD4331BE","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-04-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2014-07-31","modifiedBy":"MAESKEB","dateModified":"2020-01-08","changeDescription":"Versioned to add PVs for COG reuse per request by W.Wong. mc 7/31/14","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ClassificationSchemes":[{"publicId":"2961451","version":"1","longName":"Children's Oncology Group (COG)","context":"COG","ClassificationSchemeItems":[{"publicId":"2961452","version":"1","longName":"Statistics and Data Center","context":"COG"}]},{"publicId":"5650570","version":"1","longName":"TARGET","context":"OCG","ClassificationSchemeItems":[{"publicId":"5650571","version":"1","longName":"ALL","context":"OCG"}]}],"AlternateNames":[{"name":"COG","type":"USED_BY","context":"COG"},{"name":"CNSStatus","type":"COG GDE Short Name","context":"COG"},{"name":"OCG","type":"USED_BY","context":"OCG"}],"ReferenceDocuments":[{"name":"COG CRF Text 2","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"CNS status at initial diagnosis:","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"CNS status at diagnosis","type":"Preferred Question Text","description":"CNS status at diagnosis","url":null,"context":"NCIP"},{"name":"COG CRF Text 1","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"CNS Status","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"COG CRF Text 3","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"CNS Status:","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"COG_CRF_TEXT_4","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"What is the patient's CNS status","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"COG CRF Text 5","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"CNS status:","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"COG CRF Text 6","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"Specify CNS status if not resolved:","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"COG CRF Text 7","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"CNS Status at relapse:","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"COG CRF Text 8","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"CNS diagnosis type:","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"COG CRF Text 9","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"What was the CNS status?","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"COG CRF Text 10","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"What was the CNS status at study enrollment?","url":null,"context":"COG"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FF827481-4F0C-8927-E040-BB89AD436E27","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2014-07-31","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2014-07-31","modifiedBy":"KUMMEROA","dateModified":"2023-03-09","changeDescription":"Released CDEs per Tanja's approval on 5/12/11. mc Verioned to add PVs for COG reuse per request by W.Wong. mc 7/31/14","administrativeNotes":"2023.3.9 AQT added per ticket request CADSR0002119. ak","unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
