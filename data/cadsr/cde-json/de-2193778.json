Upon ingestion, caffeine binds to adenosine receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), which inhibits adenosine binding. This inhibits the adenosine-mediated downregulation of CNS activity; thus, stimulating the activity of the medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers in the brain. This agent also promotes neurotransmitter release that further stimulates the CNS. The anti-inflammatory effects of caffeine are due the nonselective competitive inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Inhibition of PDEs raises the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP), activates protein kinase A, and inhibits leukotriene synthesis, which leads to reduced inflammation and innate immunity.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"6FAF710E-9707-ED7D-E040-BB89AD434976","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-07-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2009-07-27","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2009-07-27","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2234899","version":"1","preferredName":"Use","preferredDefinition":"Use; put into service; make work or employ (something) for a particular purpose or for its inherent or natural purpose.","longName":"C25340","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Use","conceptCode":"C25340","definition":"A manner, or usual, or accepted practice of using something.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F9860F29-7486-7421-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-06-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-06-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-06-15","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008566","version":"1","preferredName":"Behavior","preferredDefinition":"Observations and activities relating to behavior, such as smoking and ETOH use.\r\n","longName":"BEHAVIOR","context":"SPOREs","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B78145CC-5DBF-209B-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-02-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MEDVEDOH","dateCreated":"2003-02-25","modifiedBy":"REEVESD","dateModified":"2004-11-03","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"6FAF710E-9715-ED7D-E040-BB89AD434976","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-07-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2009-07-27","modifiedBy":"COOPERM","dateModified":"2019-11-08","changeDescription":"Versioned to update to EVS concept from Meta.
