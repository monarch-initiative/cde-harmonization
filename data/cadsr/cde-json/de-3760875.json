{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3760875","version":"1","preferredName":"Reuse Template Until Repeat Activity Rule Evaluation Timepoint Code ISO21090.CD.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"A coded value specifying the points in the course of an activity when a precondition for the activity is evaluated. EXAMPLE(S): (1) When the checkpoint code for a criterion of a repeatable activity is \"end,\" the criterion is tested only at the end of each repetition of that activity. When the condition holds true, the next repetition is ready for execution. (2) When the checkpoint code is \"entry,\" the criterion is checked at the beginning of each repetition, if any, whereas \"beginning\" means the criterion is checked only once before the repetition \"loop\" starts. NOTE(S): The checkpoint code specifies when the precondition is to be checked; it is analogous to the various conditional statements and loop constructs in programming languages \"while-do\" vs. \"do-while\" or \"repeat-until\" vs. \"loop-exit.\"","longName":"3760093v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760093","version":"1","preferredName":"Reuse Template Until Repeat
