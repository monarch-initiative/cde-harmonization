The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. This protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is known to metabolize as many as 20% of commonly prescribed drugs. Its substrates include debrisoquine, an adrenergic-blocking drug; sparteine and propafenone, both anti-arrhythmic drugs; and amitriptyline, an anti-depressant. The gene is highly polymorphic in the population; certain alleles result in the poor metabolizer phenotype, characterized by a decreased ability to metabolize the enzyme's substrates.
