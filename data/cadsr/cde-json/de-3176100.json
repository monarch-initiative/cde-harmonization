The approach site might be \"mouth\", but from a route code perspective, this could include: swallow, oral rinse, oral topical application, chew, oral dissolve, oral inhalation (via intermittent flow or rebreather mask). The effect of the drug could vary depending on the route even if the body site happens to be the same. NOTE(S): Route is more than just approach site. It deals with how the body will actually absorb/receive the drug.","longName":"3174949v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3174949","version":"1","preferredName":"Substance Administration Intervention or Procedure Performed Study Activity Administration Route Code","preferredDefinition":"A material with particular features.:The act of the dispensing, applying, or tendering of something to another, such as administration of a medicine.:An activity that produces an effect, or that is intended to alter the course of a disease in a patient or population.
