The degree of differentiation often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"05DCF04B-6253-39CC-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-11-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CAP","dateCreated":"2005-11-18","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"3099631","version":"1","preferredName":"Flag Quantitative","preferredDefinition":"An indicator that can be set or unset in order to signal whether a particular condition is true.:Capable of being estimated or expressed with numeric values.","longName":"C43578:C70766","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Flag","conceptCode":"C43578","definition":"An indicator that can be set or unset in order to signal whether a particular condition is true.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Quantitative Concept","conceptCode":"C70766","definition":"Capable of being estimated or expressed with numeric values.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"876FBB79-1D7B-3994-E040-BB89AD434D9A","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-05-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CALIMS2P","dateCreated":"2010-05-25","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-05-25","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2222502","version":"1","preferredName":"UML DEFAULT CD","preferredDefinition":"Default Conceptual Domain for UML Loader","longName":"UML DEFAULT CD","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F5E53F3B-47A4-52D1-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2005-04-29","modifiedBy":"DWARZEL","dateModified":"2021-04-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"876FF86C-E36C-21DD-E040-BB89AD431C7E","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-05-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CALIMS2P","dateCreated":"2010-05-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":"8/12/2010 released at request of caLIMS2 model owner","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2178538","version":"1","preferredName":"java.lang.Boolean","preferredDefinition":"Generic value domain for a primitive java datatype that is a Boolean value (true or false).","longName":"java.lang.Boolean","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"java.lang.Boolean","minLength":null,"maxLength":null,"minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2178532","version":"1","preferredName":"Bioinformatics","preferredDefinition":".","longName":"BIOINFORMATICS","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RETIRED ARCHIVED","registrationStatus":"Retired","id":"CD81DD3C-8FFA-28BA-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-12-02","endDate":"2020-10-14","createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-12-02","modifiedBy":"TAYLORT","dateModified":"2020-10-14","changeDescription":"10.14.20 TL changed WFS from DRAFT NEW to RETIRED ARCHIVED and added an End Date in preparation of OneData.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2320047","version":"1","preferredName":"Indicator","preferredDefinition":"An event, entity or condition that typically characterizes a prescribed environment or situation.
