The degree of differentiation often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"212041FE-917F-43DD-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-10-31","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CAE","dateCreated":"2006-10-31","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2512773","version":"1","preferredName":"Grade","preferredDefinition":"A position on a scale of intensity or amount or quality.","longName":"C48309","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Grade","conceptCode":"C48309","definition":"A position on a scale of intensity or amount or quality.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"1B8A7889-584C-2DCB-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-08-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_AGNIS","dateCreated":"2006-08-21","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2222502","version":"1","preferredName":"UML DEFAULT CD","preferredDefinition":"Default Conceptual Domain for UML Loader","longName":"UML DEFAULT CD","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F5E53F3B-47A4-52D1-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2005-04-29","modifiedBy":"DWARZEL","dateModified":"2021-04-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"212053F7-F937-5061-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-10-31","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CAE","dateCreated":"2006-10-31","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2178533","version":"1","preferredName":"java.lang.String","preferredDefinition":"Generic value domain for a java datatype that is a class that represents character strings.","longName":"java.lang.String","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"java.lang.String","minLength":null,"maxLength":null,"minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2178532","version":"1","preferredName":"Bioinformatics","preferredDefinition":".","longName":"BIOINFORMATICS","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RETIRED ARCHIVED","registrationStatus":"Retired","id":"CD81DD3C-8FFA-28BA-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-12-02","endDate":"2020-10-14","createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-12-02","modifiedBy":"TAYLORT","dateModified":"2020-10-14","changeDescription":"10.14.20 TL changed WFS from DRAFT NEW to RETIRED ARCHIVED and added an End Date in preparation of OneData.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2234203","version":"1","preferredName":"Text","preferredDefinition":"Text;
