CD3 also mediates TCR signal transduction during the developmental transition through positive selection of immature thymocytes to mature CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. (NCI):CD4 Antigen, encoded by the CD4 gene, is a T-cell surface glycoprotein. CD4 has a role in cell-cell interactions and may act in signal transduction. CD4 is a accessory protein for MHC class-II antigen/T-cell receptor interaction and functions to initiate or augment the early phase of T-cell activation. CD4 enhances T-cell sensitivity to antigen and binds to LCK, which phosphorylates CD3-zeta. CD4 Antigen also serves as an HIV receptor, binding directly to the envelope protein gp120 on HIV. (From LocusLink, OMIM and NCI):Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.","longName":"C38897:C16300:C25294","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"CD3 Complex","conceptCode":"C38897","definition":"A protein complex comprised of one T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 delta chain (CD3D), one T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 gamma chain (CD3G) and two T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 epsilon chains (CD3E). CD3D, CD3G and CD3E are transmembrane proteins with one extracellular immunoglobulin domain and one intracellular ITAM domain. The CD3 complex is a T-cell co-receptor that noncovalently associates with either the disulfide bound heterodimeric alpha/beta T-cell receptor (TCR) or gamma/delta TCR and two copies of the accessory protein, T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 zeta chain (CD247), which is a transmembrane protein with three ITAM domains. The TCR moiety of the TCR-CD3 complex binds to MHC and processed antigens on antigen presenting cells, which triggers phosphorylation of and cellular propagation of the signal by CD247 and the CD3 complex.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"T-Cell Surface Glycoprotein CD4","conceptCode":"C16300","definition":"T-cell surface glycoprotein CD4 (458 aa, ~51 kDa) is encoded by the human CD4 gene.
