The result of the process may be similar or different kind of material, e.g. specimen may be result of specimen processing step (aliquot or division of a specimen), or alternatively blood product has anticoagulants added to it to preserve product. Other processing steps, e.g. adding growth factor to induce cell growth, may be performed on blood product. A coded value specifying the technique that is used to perform the procedure.
