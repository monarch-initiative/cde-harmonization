CYP3A4 is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway and phase I oxidative metabolism of carcinogens, steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics, as well as bioactivation of aflatoxin B(1) to a genotoxic derivative. Activity seems a key predictor of drug responsiveness and toxicity. (from LocusLink, Swiss-Prot, OMIM, and NCI):A Substrate Domain is a protein region that physically interacts stereospecifically, and usually at high affinity, with a specific target substrate. In enzymes, the substrate domain is often, though not necessarily, coincident with the catalytic domain. Typically, substrate interaction results in some protein conformational alteration and functional modification.
