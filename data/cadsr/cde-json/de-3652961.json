Although the exact mechanism through which acetaminophen exert its effects has yet to be fully determined, acetaminophen may inhibit the nitric oxide (NO) pathway mediated by a variety of neurotransmitter receptors including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and substance P, resulting in elevation of the pain threshold. The antipyretic activity may result from inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and release in the central nervous system (CNS) and prostaglandin-mediated effects on the heat-regulating center in the anterior hypothalamus.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"197DA559-57D2-56C9-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-07-26","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-07-26","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-07-26","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2233610","version":"1","preferredName":"Administered","preferredDefinition":"Given.","longName":"C25382","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Administered","conceptCode":"C25382","definition":"The act of having given something (e.g., a medication or test).","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F95D94B9-D864-2792-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-06-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-06-13","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-06-13","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2435024","version":"1","preferredName":"Drug or Chemical","preferredDefinition":"A category of organic or inorganic substances, elements, and isotopes used in research or for the prevention, diagnosis, and/or treatment of disease states.
