It is the most common malignant tumor in females. Risk factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens, contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation. The vast majority of breast carcinomas are adenocarcinomas (ductal or lobular). Breast carcinoma spreads by direct invasion, by the lymphatic route, and by the blood vessel route. The most common site of lymph node involvement is the axilla.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Other","conceptCode":"C17649","definition":"Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Histologic Grade","conceptCode":"C18000","definition":"The degree of abnormality of cancer cells, a measure of differentiation, the extent to which cancer cells are similar in appearance and function to healthy cells of the same tissue type. The degree of differentiation often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"24981431-38F3-60DA-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-12-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CATRIP","dateCreated":"2006-12-14","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2222848","version":"1","preferredName":"Identifier","preferredDefinition":"One or more characters used to identify, name, or characterize the nature, properties, or contents of a thing.","longName":"C25364","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Identifier","conceptCode":"C25364","definition":"One or more characters used to identify, name, or characterize the nature, properties, or contents of a thing.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F62113C1-8528-4E73-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-02","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_EVS","dateCreated":"2005-05-02","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2222502","version":"1","preferredName":"UML DEFAULT CD","preferredDefinition":"Default Conceptual Domain for UML Loader","longName":"UML DEFAULT CD","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F5E53F3B-47A4-52D1-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2005-04-29","modifiedBy":"DWARZEL","dateModified":"2021-04-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2498218C-C75E-6BE9-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-12-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CATRIP","dateCreated":"2006-12-14","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2178534","version":"1","preferredName":"java.lang.Long","preferredDefinition":"Generic value domain for a primitive java dataype that is a long integer (64-bit two's complement).","longName":"java.lang.Long","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"java.lang.Long","minLength":null,"maxLength":null,"minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2178532","version":"1","preferredName":"Bioinformatics","preferredDefinition":".","longName":"BIOINFORMATICS","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RETIRED ARCHIVED","registrationStatus":"Retired","id":"CD81DD3C-8FFA-28BA-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-12-02","endDate":"2020-10-14","createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-12-02","modifiedBy":"TAYLORT","dateModified":"2020-10-14","changeDescription":"10.14.20 TL changed WFS from DRAFT NEW to RETIRED ARCHIVED and added an End Date in preparation of OneData.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2233101","version":"1","preferredName":"Number","preferredDefinition":"Number;
