Rare cases of solitary masses in the omentum or the mesentery have also been reported (extragastrointestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumor).  It is a tumor that differentiates along the lines of interstitial cells of Cajal.  Most cases contain KIT- or PDGFRA-activating mutations. Until recently, surgery has been the only effective therapy for this tumor.  However, many patients still experience recurrence.  Conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been of limited value.  A KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (also known as STI-571 or Gleevec), is now effective in the treatment of relapsed and unresectable cases.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"69CC3F8C-54D3-DD89-E040-BB89AD4301CB","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-05-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2009-05-13","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2009-05-13","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2875747","version":"1","preferredName":"Growth Factor Adjuvant Therapy First Recurrence","preferredDefinition":"Substances made by the body that function to regulate cell division and cell survival.
