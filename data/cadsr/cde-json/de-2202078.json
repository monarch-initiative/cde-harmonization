Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"ACAAECCE-7A0E-657B-E034-0003BA0B1A09","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-10-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2002-10-29","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-03-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2177321","version":"1","preferredName":"Use","preferredDefinition":"Use; put into service; make work or employ (something) for a particular purpose or for its inherent or natural purpose.","longName":"Use","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","Concepts":[{"longName":"Use","conceptCode":"C25340","definition":"A manner, or usual, or accepted practice of using something.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"AE29A78C-52CF-3A05-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-10-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2002-10-29","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-03-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008571","version":"1","preferredName":"Chronic or Associated Diseases and Exposures","preferredDefinition":"chronic diseases, as well as diseases and exposures associated with cancer.","longName":"CHR_O_ASS_DZ_AND_EXP","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B9B9249B-AB81-2F8D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-03-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-03-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"D02C4F95-E0D5-2B51-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2004-01-05","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2004-01-05","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2202076","version":"1","preferredName":"Alcohol Past Month Number","preferredDefinition":"The number of alcoholic beverages consumed in the during the past month.","longName":"ALC_PAST_MON_NUM","context":"DCP","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"NUMBER","minLength":null,"maxLength":"4","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008566","version":"1","preferredName":"Behavior","preferredDefinition":"Observations and activities relating to behavior, such as smoking and ETOH use.\r\n","longName":"BEHAVIOR","context":"SPOREs","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B78145CC-5DBF-209B-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-02-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MEDVEDOH","dateCreated":"2003-02-25","modifiedBy":"REEVESD","dateModified":"2004-11-03","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2193938","version":"1","preferredName":"Number","preferredDefinition":"A symbol or string of symbols expressing value, quantity, or identification.
