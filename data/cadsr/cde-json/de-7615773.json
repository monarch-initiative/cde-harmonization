Although the precise mechanism of action is unknown, hydroxychloroquine may suppress immune function by interfering with the processing and presentation of antigens and the production of cytokines. As a lysosomotropic agent, hydroxychloroquine raises intralysosomal pH, impairing autophagic protein degradation; hydroxychloroquine-mediated accumulation of ineffective autophagosomes may result in cell death in tumor cells reliant on autophagy for survival.  In addition, this agent is highly active against the erythrocytic forms of P. vivax and malariae and most strains of P. falciparum but not the gametocytes of P. falciparum.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B914C2F8-AF6A-3067-E040-BB89AD433056","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2012-02-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-02-16","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"2C5DDD88-FB24-F93D-E050-BB89AD437D4E","beginDate":"2016-02-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2016-02-22","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2016-02-22","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Interleukin inhibitors","valueDescription":"Interleukin Inhibitor","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"5127431","version":"1","preferredName":"Interleukin Inhibitor","longName":"5127431","preferredDefinition":"Any agent that inhibits the action of an interleukin.

It is also used for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose as it can restore the depleted GSH reserves in the hepatocytes during the process of detoxification.

In addition, this may inhibit tumor cell proliferation, progression and survival, in susceptible tumor cells that rely on ROS-mediated signaling for their proliferation and malignant behavior. Under certain circumstances, acetylcysteine is able to induce apoptosis in susceptible cells, including certain tumor cells, via the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway but not involving endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Obinutuzumab, a third generation type II anti-CD20 antibody, selectivity binds to the extracellular domain of the human CD20 antigen on malignant human B cells. The Fc region carbohydrates of the antibody, enriched in bisected non-fucosylated glycosylation variants, contribute to its higher binding affinity for human FcgammaRIII receptors compared to non-glycoengineered antibodies, resulting in enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and caspase-independent apoptosis. In addition, modification of elbow hinge sequences within the antibody variable framework regions may account for the strong apoptosis-inducing activity of R7159 upon binding to CD20 on target cells.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"28ACEAFB-4750-6667-E050-BB89AD432DA7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2016-01-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2016-01-06","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"4EA044AC-B535-3351-E053-F662850A8B45","beginDate":"2017-05-03","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2017-05-03","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2017-05-03","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Ponatinib","valueDescription":"Ponatinib","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3776076","version":"1","preferredName":"Ponatinib","longName":"3776076","preferredDefinition":"An orally bioavailable multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities.

In addition, belantamab mafodotin induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Altogether, this results in the inhibition of cellular proliferation in tumor cells that overexpress BCMA. BCMA, a receptor for a proliferation-inducing ligand and B-cell activating factor, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and plays a key role in plasma cell survival; it is found on the surfaces of plasma cells and overexpressed on malignant plasma cells. Afucosylation of the antibody moiety increases ADCC.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B9BFD69E-EF64-380D-E053-4EBD850ADDF3","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2021-01-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MALUMK","dateCreated":"2021-01-25","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2021-01-25","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"B9BFD69E-EF7D-380D-E053-4EBD850ADDF3","beginDate":"2021-01-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MALUMK","dateCreated":"2021-01-25","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2021-01-25","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)","valueDescription":"Mesenchymal Stem Cell","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"4197222","version":"1","preferredName":"Mesenchymal Stem Cell","longName":"4197222","preferredDefinition":"An undifferentiated stromal cell with the ability to develop into the cells that form distinct mesenchymal tissues; such as bone, muscle, connective tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatic tissue.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Mesenchymal Stem Cell","conceptCode":"C43423","definition":"An undifferentiated stromal cell with the ability to develop into the cells that form distinct mesenchymal tissues; such as bone, muscle, connective tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatic tissue.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F3F1A516-3B13-2DD9-E040-BB89AD434115","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2014-03-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COLBERTM","dateCreated":"2014-03-06","modifiedBy":"MAESKEB","dateModified":"2022-04-04","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"BE5F4378-4CCF-44A4-E053-4EBD850A4063","beginDate":"2021-03-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MALUMK","dateCreated":"2021-03-25","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2021-03-25","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Corticosteroids - Pulse dose","valueDescription":"Pulse Steroids","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"7797672","version":"1","preferredName":"Pulse Steroids","longName":"7797672","preferredDefinition":"Intermittent therapeutic administration of high doses of steroids over short periods of time.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Pulse Steroids","conceptCode":"C182447","definition":"Intermittent therapeutic administration of high doses of steroids over short periods of time.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"CE15B07E-F6F0-19D0-E053-4EBD850ACFE8","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2021-10-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MALUMK","dateCreated":"2021-10-11","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2021-10-11","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"CE15B07E-F709-19D0-E053-4EBD850ACFE8","beginDate":"2021-10-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MALUMK","dateCreated":"2021-10-11","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2021-10-11","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"GTE:GTO oil (Lorenzo's oil)","valueDescription":"Lorenzo's Oil","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"7681465","version":"1","preferredName":"Lorenzo's Oil","longName":"7681465","preferredDefinition":"An orally-administered oil composed of the monounsaturated fatty acids glyceryl trioleate (GTO), the triacylglycerol form of oleic acid derived from olive oil, and glyceryl trierucate (GTE), the triacylglycerol form of erucic acid derived from rapeseed oil, in a 4:1 ratio, that can be used in the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).
