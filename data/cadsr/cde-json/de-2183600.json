Pregabalin does not bind directly to GABA-A or GABA-B receptors and does not alter GABA uptake or degradation.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"E2D696CA-9334-9226-E040-BB89AD4309FC","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2013-07-31","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2013-07-31","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"97A39E9F-9ABB-4341-E053-F662850A0D2A","beginDate":"2019-11-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2019-11-18","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-11-18","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Pravastatin","valueDescription":"Pravastatin","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3379491","version":"1","preferredName":"Pravastatin","longName":"3379491","preferredDefinition":"A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.

Upon intravenous or intramuscular administration, human Rho(D) immune globulin provides Rho(D) antibodies against Rho(D) antigens which suppresses Rh isoimmunization. By providing sufficient anti-Rho(D) antibodies, human anti-Rho(D) immune globulin accelerates the phagocytosis of Rho(D)-positive RBCs, which clears these RBCs from the circulation. This prevents the recognition of Rho(D)-positive RBCs by the immune system and the subsequent formation of anti-Rho(D) antibodies in individuals with Rh-negative blood after exposure to Rh-positive RBCs. This prevents the production of alloantibodies to paternally inherited RhD antigen expressed on fetal erythrocytes in Rho-negative mothers and prevents hemolytic diseases in newborns.

Upon administration, acetylcysteine exerts its mucolytic activity by reducing disulfide bonds in mucoproteins, resulting in liquification of mucus and reducing its viscosity. It is also used for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose as it can restore the depleted GSH reserves in the hepatocytes during the process of detoxification.  The antioxidant activity is attributed to the ability of GSH to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby preventing ROS-mediated cell damage, decreasing oxidative stress, protecting cells against the damaging effects of free radicals and preventing apoptosis in these cells. In addition, this may inhibit tumor cell proliferation, progression and survival, in susceptible tumor cells that rely on ROS-mediated signaling for their proliferation and malignant behavior. Under certain circumstances, acetylcysteine is able to induce apoptosis in susceptible cells, including certain tumor cells, via the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway but not involving endoplasmic reticulum stress. Also, acetylcysteine may also be able to degrade Notch2, thereby preventing proliferation, migration, and invasion in Notch2-overexpressing glioblastoma cells.

Olanzapine may also stimulate appetite.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B1D487B9-D1F1-491E-E040-BB89AD432EE4","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-11-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2011-11-16","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"9768B702-9489-18F7-E053-F662850A60B1","beginDate":"2011-11-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2019-11-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-11-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Nefludan","valueDescription":"Nefludan","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3335019","version":"1","preferredName":"Nefludan","longName":"3335019","preferredDefinition":"Nefludan","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B43B6E2B-6148-FD19-E040-BB89AD437374","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-12-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2011-12-16","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"9768B702-9493-18F7-E053-F662850A60B1","beginDate":"2011-12-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2019-11-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-11-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Nefazadone HCL","valueDescription":"Nefazodone Hydrochloride","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3335021","version":"1","preferredName":"Nefazodone Hydrochloride","longName":"3335021","preferredDefinition":"A synthetic derivative of phenylpiperazine and chemically unrelated to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, tetracyclics, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), antidepressant Nefazadone Hydrochloride antagonizes central 5-HT2 receptors and inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.

Nilotinib also inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R; PDGFR), mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit (c-Kit), and, to a lesser extent, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R; CSF1R), and discoidin domain-containing receptor 1 (DDR1).","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"860CCE3A-0AF9-57F9-E053-F662850ACDA8","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2019-04-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2019-04-09","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-04-09","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"9768B702-9B05-18F7-E053-F662850A60B1","beginDate":"2019-04-05","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2019-11-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-11-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Doxylamine Succinate","valueDescription":"Doxylamine Succinate (Unisom)","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"6941798","version":"1","preferredName":"Doxylamine Succinate (Unisom)","longName":"6941798","preferredDefinition":"A pyridine derivate histamine H1 antagonist with pronounced sedative properties.

Levetiracetam inhibits burst firing without affecting normal neuronal excitability, which suggests that it may selectively prevent hyper-synchronization of epileptiform burst firing and propagation of seizure activity.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-FE9A-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-03-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-03-14","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-03-14","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"9768B702-7DFF-18F7-E053-F662850A60B1","beginDate":"2006-03-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2019-11-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-11-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Ketamine HCL","valueDescription":"Ketamine Hydrochloride","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2578222","version":"1","preferredName":"Ketamine Hydrochloride","longName":"2578222","preferredDefinition":"A synthetic nonbarbiturate anesthetic derivative of cyclohexanone, Ketamine Hydrochloride can block NMDA receptors (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and may interact with sigma receptors.

Glutamine may become a conditionally essential amino acid during certain catabolic states.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-FD5D-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-02-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-02-23","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA_WA","dateModified":"2023-09-18","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"9768B702-7F35-18F7-E053-F662850A60B1","beginDate":"2006-02-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2019-11-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-11-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Glyburide","valueDescription":"Glyburide","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2577905","version":"1","preferredName":"Glyburide","longName":"2577905","preferredDefinition":"No value exists.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Glyburide","conceptCode":"C29076","definition":"A sulfonamide urea derivative with antihyperglycemic activity that can potentially be used to decrease cerebral edema. Upon administration, glyburide binds to and blocks the sulfonylurea receptor type 1 (SUR1) subunit of the ATP-sensitive inwardly-rectifying potassium (K(ATP)) channels on the membranes of pancreatic beta cells. This prevents the inward current flow of positively charged potassium (K+) ions into the cell, and induces a calcium ion (Ca2+) influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, which triggers exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. In addition, glyburide also inhibits the SUR1-regulated nonselective cation (NC) Ca-ATP channel, melastatin 4 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4; (TRPM4)), thereby preventing capillary failure and brain swelling. SUR1-TRPM4 channels are formed by co-assembly of SUR1 with TRPM4 in neurons, astrocytes, and capillary endothelium during cerebral ischemia. Upon ischemia-induced ATP depletion, channels open which results in sodium influx, cytotoxic edema formation, capillary fragmentation and necrotic cell death.

ACL is an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FB322F82-DB84-2FB1-E053-731AD00A5A67","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2023-05-08","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2023-05-08","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2023-05-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"FB322F82-DB89-2FB1-E053-731AD00A5A67","beginDate":"2023-05-08","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2023-05-08","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2023-05-08","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Semaglutide","valueDescription":null,"ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"13552970","version":"1","preferredName":"Semaglutide (Ozempic)","longName":"13552970v1.00","preferredDefinition":"No value exists.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Semaglutide","conceptCode":"C152328","definition":"A glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is 94% homologous to human GLP-1 (7-37), with antihyperglycemic and appetite regulating activities. Upon administration, semaglutide binds to and activates GLP-1 receptor. In pancreatic beta cells, this increases glucose-dependent insulin release. Semaglutide also reduces the elevated glucagon secretion by inhibiting alpha cells of the pancreas and slows gastric emptying. Altogether this lowers the postprandial glucose level. In the brain, the binding to and activation of GLP-1 receptor suppresses appetite, which decreases caloric intake and lowers body weight. GLP-1 is normally secreted by L cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa in response to a meal to normalize blood glucose levels. It also plays an important role in the regulation of appetite and caloric intake.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FB48ADCD-1958-299D-E053-731AD00ACF88","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2023-05-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2023-05-09","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2023-05-09","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"FB48ADCD-195A-299D-E053-731AD00ACF88","beginDate":"2023-05-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2023-05-09","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2023-05-09","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Eye Multivitamin","valueDescription":null,"ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"13552971","version":"1","preferredName":"Eye Multivitamin (Macuhealth)","longName":"13552971v1.00","preferredDefinition":"The organ of sight or vision._A dietary supplement containing all or most of the vitamins that may not be readily available in the diet.

As a result, this agent causes DNA adducts formation, renders single- and double-stranded DNA breakages that induce DNA repair and or apoptotic processes. Doxorubicin also generates reactive oxygen species that leads to cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids. Liposomal delivery of doxorubicin HCl improves drug penetration into tumors and decreases drug clearance, thereby increasing the duration of therapeutic drug effects.
