A patients family medical history may be important in diagnosing existing conditions. (NCI)_An autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by the presence of multiple adenomas in the colon and rectum. It is caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene which is located on the long arm of chromosome 5. The adenomas are most often tubular, and they have the tendency to progress to adenocarcinoma. They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during endoscopic examination between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase in size and numbers with age, and there is usually progression of one or more adenomas to adenocarcinoma. The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is about 40 years. Signs include rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea. Patients have an increased incidence of developing abdominal or retroperitoneal desmoid tumors, bone exostoses, dental abnormalities, and epidermal cysts._Generic value domain for a java datatype that is a class that represents character strings.","longName":"2678299v1.0:2178533v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"2678299","version":"1","preferredName":"Family Medical History Adenomatous Polyposis Coli","preferredDefinition":"A record of a patient's background regarding health and disease events of blood relatives.
