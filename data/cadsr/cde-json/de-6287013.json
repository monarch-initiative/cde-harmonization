This agent also stimulates dopamine D2 receptors in the anterior pituitary gland, which results in the inhibition of prolactin secretion and lactation and may inhibit the proliferation of prolactin-dependent breast cancer cells.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-FCD3-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-02-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-02-20","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-02-20","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"6C3F2828-42E2-677F-E053-F662850A5F7B","beginDate":"2006-02-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-05-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-05-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Bromphenex","valueDescription":"Dextromethorphan Elixir","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2577773","version":"1","preferredName":"Dextromethorphan Elixir","longName":"2577773v1.00","preferredDefinition":"No value exists.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Dextromethorphan Elixir","conceptCode":"C1250553","definition":"No value exists.","evsSource":"UMLS_CUI","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-FCDA-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-02-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-02-21","modifiedBy":"CLOHNES","dateModified":"2023-11-28","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"6C3F2828-42EC-677F-E053-F662850A5F7B","beginDate":"2006-02-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-05-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-05-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Brompheniramine Maleate/Pseudo","valueDescription":"Brompheniramine maleate + pseudoephedrine hydrochloride","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2577767","version":"1","preferredName":"Brompheniramine maleate + pseudoephedrine hydrochloride","longName":"2577767","preferredDefinition":"No value exists.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Brompheniramine maleate + pseudoephedrine hydrochloride","conceptCode":"CL311551","definition":"No value exists.","evsSource":"NCI_META_CUI","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-FCD4-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-02-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-02-20","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-02-20","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"6C3F2828-42F6-677F-E053-F662850A5F7B","beginDate":"2006-02-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-05-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-05-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Brotizolam","valueDescription":"Brotizolam","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2576031","version":"1","preferredName":"Brotizolam","longName":"2576031","preferredDefinition":"No value exists.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"brotizolam","conceptCode":"C0054151","definition":"No value exists.","evsSource":"UMLS_CUI","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-F60C-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-08-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2005-08-29","modifiedBy":"REEVESD","dateModified":"2006-02-21","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"6C3F2828-4300-677F-E053-F662850A5F7B","beginDate":"2006-02-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-05-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-05-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Budesonide","valueDescription":"Budesonide","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2576032","version":"1","preferredName":"Budesonide","longName":"2576032","preferredDefinition":"A glucocorticoid used in the management of asthma, the treatment of various skin disorders, and allergic rhinitis.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Budesonide","conceptCode":"C1027","definition":"A synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties.

The CysLT1 receptor is found in a number of tissues including spleen, lung, placenta, small intestine, and nasal mucosa, and in a variety of cell types including monocyte/macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, CD34-positive hemopoietic progenitor cells, neutrophils and endothelial cells.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-FEED-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-03-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-03-15","modifiedBy":"REEVESD","dateModified":"2010-04-26","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"6C3F2828-5C61-677F-E053-F662850A5F7B","beginDate":"2006-03-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-05-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-05-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Morphine Sulfate","valueDescription":"Morphine Sulfate","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2578305","version":"1","preferredName":"Morphine Sulfate","longName":"2578305","preferredDefinition":"An opiate alkaloid isolated from the plant Papaver somniferum and produced synthetically.

In the kidney, inhibition of the beta-2 receptor within the juxtaglomerular apparatus results in the inhibition of renin production and a subsequent reduction in angiotensin II and aldosterone levels, thus inhibiting angiotensin II-dependent vasoconstriction and aldosterone-dependent water retention.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-FEF6-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-03-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-03-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-03-15","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"6C3F2828-5CED-677F-E053-F662850A5F7B","beginDate":"2006-03-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-05-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-05-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Nafcillin","valueDescription":"Nafcillin","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2575691","version":"1","preferredName":"Nafcillin","longName":"2575691","preferredDefinition":"A semi-synthetic naphthalene and beta-lactam antibiotic with antibacterial activity.

Fluocinolone exerts its vasoconstrictive effect through inhibition of nitric oxide synthase, thereby blocking nitric oxide production and effectively diminishing the effect of nitric oxide on vascular smooth muscles leading to reduced blood flow.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"A8EB450A-8D5A-6148-E040-BB89AD431193","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-07-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2011-07-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"6C3F2828-5011-677F-E053-F662850A5F7B","beginDate":"2011-07-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-05-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-05-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Fluocinonide","valueDescription":"Fluocinonide","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2576865","version":"1","preferredName":"Fluocinonide","longName":"2576865v1.00","preferredDefinition":"A synthetic glucocorticoid and derivative of fluocinolone acetonide with anti-inflammatory and antipruritic activities.

Finally, transcriptional activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B is blocked, thereby inhibits the transcription of cyclooxygenase 2, which is essential for prostaglandin production.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"A8EA5DCE-9213-385A-E040-BB89AD436355","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-07-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2011-07-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"6C3F2828-509F-677F-E053-F662850A5F7B","beginDate":"2011-07-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-05-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-05-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol","valueDescription":"fluticasone propionate - salmeterol combination","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2577873","version":"1","preferredName":"fluticasone propionate - salmeterol combination","longName":"2577873","preferredDefinition":"No value exists.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"fluticasone propionate - salmeterol combination","conceptCode":"C1176242","definition":"No value exists.","evsSource":"UMLS_CUI","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-FD3E-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-02-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-02-22","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-02-22","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"6C3F2828-50A9-677F-E053-F662850A5F7B","beginDate":"2006-02-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-05-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-05-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Fluvastatin Sodium","valueDescription":"Fluvastatin Sodium","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2576874","version":"1","preferredName":"Fluvastatin Sodium","longName":"2576874","preferredDefinition":"A synthetic lipid-lowering agent.
