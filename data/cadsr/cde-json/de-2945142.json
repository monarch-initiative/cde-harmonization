Also called biomarker.:Antigen Identified by Monoclonal Antibody Ki-67, encoded by the MKI67 gene, is a nuclear antigen expressed in proliferating cells but not in quiescent cells, and required for maintaining cell proliferation. Expression of this antigen occurs preferentially during late G1, S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle, while in cells in G0 phase the antigen cannot be detected. Consequently, the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 is used in tumor pathology to detect proliferating cells in neoplastic diseases. This antigen is located in the nucleus, predominantly localized in the G1 phase in the perinucleolar region. In the later phases it is also detected throughout the nuclear interior, being predominantly localized in the nuclear matrix. In mitosis, it is present on all chromosomes. This antigen contains 1 FHA domain. Two alternative splicing forms exist, Long and Short.
