Upon administration during tumor resection, the peptide component of LS301 specifically targets and binds integrin receptors expressed on tumor cells, which are not expressed on normal, healthy cells. Upon receptor-mediated endocytosis and fluorescence imaging using infrared light that is visualized by the surgeon with special Cancer Vision Goggles (CVG), tumor cells can be detected, identified, and removed accordingly. This enhances the accuracy of cancer cell removal during surgery. The D-cysteine on the peptide prevents degradation by endogenous proteases.:The words of something written.","longName":"14767254v1.00:6784451v1.00","context":"CRDC","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"14767254","version":"1","preferredName":"Multiplex Imaging Fluorescent Dye","preferredDefinition":"A proprietary technology platform that uses a known set of oligonucleotide barcodes in combination with methods for assessing single cell gene expression using barcode-conjugated primers, detecting cell surface expression of proteins via capture with barcode-conjugated antibodies, mapping of B-cell and T-cell receptor targets through tagging with barcode-conjugated antigens and targeted analysis of promoter effects on gene expression via CRISPR perturbation with barcode-conjugated guide RNAs.:A class of dyes when excited by light of certain wavelengths, emit photons and become fluorescent.
