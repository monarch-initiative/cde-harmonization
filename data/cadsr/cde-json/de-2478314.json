It represents approximately 50% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and is characterized by the expression of CD10, BCL-6, A-myb, and LMO2 genes, BCL-2 translocation, and c-REL amplification.  Morphologically, the vast majority of these lymphomas are centroblastic and a small minority are immunoblastic (ratio20:1).  Patients with this type of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma have a more favorable outcome, with a 5-year survival rate of 60% and a median survival of 10 years.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"9A602691-7F26-B189-E040-BB89AD437FA7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-01-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2011-01-21","modifiedBy":"FINCHAMB","dateModified":"2023-02-14","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"BDD68016-50A8-106E-E053-4EBD850AEB8B","beginDate":"2011-01-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2021-03-18","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2021-03-18","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"c-MYC+ Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma","valueDescription":"Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3378118","version":"1","preferredName":"Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma","longName":"3378118","preferredDefinition":"Myc proto-oncogene protein (439 aa, ~49 kDa) is encoded by the human MYC gene.
