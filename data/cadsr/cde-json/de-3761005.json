EXAMPLE(S): death, back pain, headache, pulmonary embolism, heart attack A coded value specifying the anatomic location that is the focus of an observation result. EXAMPLE(S): arm for skin rash. NOTE(S): (1) The target site of the observation result may be different than the target site of the observation that generated it. For instance, the target site of the observation may be broad (e.g. skin) while the target site of the observation result is specific (e.g. skin on chest). (2) Anatomic site and laterality both are included in this concept.","longName":"3760223v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760223","version":"1","preferredName":"Adverse Event Reuse Template Observation Outcome Target Anatomic Site Code","preferredDefinition":"Any unfavorable or unintended symptom, sign, or disease including an abnormal laboratory finding) temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.
