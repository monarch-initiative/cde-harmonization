Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"5ECFF3E6-BD76-F78B-E040-BB89AD435BED","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-12-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2008-12-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-12-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2820848","version":"1","preferredName":"Past Month Consumption Quantity","preferredDefinition":"Past; before the present time.:One of the 12 divisions of a year as determined by a calendar.
