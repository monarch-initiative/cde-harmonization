{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3175850","version":"1","preferredName":"Plan Upon Conditional Relationship Delay Quantity ISO21090.URG.PQ.TIME.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"A quantity of time that should elapse between when an activity is ready for execution and the actual beginning of the execution. EXAMPLE(S): Take a blood sample 15 minutes after administration of study drug or measure blood glucose 2 hours after each meal, the pauseQuantity would be 15 minutes and 2 hours respectively. For the more complex examples of doing activity A 5 minutes after the start of B or 5 minutes after the end of B, use pauseQuantity in combination with completionRequiredBeforeStartingIndicator where the pauseQuantity in both cases would be 5 minutes and \"after the start of\" would be completionRequiredBeforeStartingIndicator = \"N\" and \"after the end of\" = \"Y\". NOTE(S): The pauseQuantity defines the amount of time between two points in time: (1) the point when all preceding steps (in sequence) and preconditions of an activity have been completed, and (2) the actual start of the activity. The completion of all pre-conditions and preceding steps (based on sequence number) indicates that an activity is \"ready for execution\" according to the definition above. The pauseQuantity counter or timeclock starts then, and when the full amount of time is reached, the activity begins. A pauseQuantity with a negative value means that the activity starts some amount of time prior to the estimated time that the activity is \"ready for execution\", i.e. prior to the estimated time that the pre-conditions and preceding steps will be completed.","longName":"3174741v1.0:3152486v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3174741","version":"1","preferredName":"Plan Upon Conditional Relationship
