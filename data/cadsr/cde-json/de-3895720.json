Activated by a range of drugs, PXR binds to CYP3A4 promoter to induce CYP3A4 expression. CAR also regulates CYP3A4 expression. HNF4A is critical in PXR and CAR transcriptional activation. CYP3A3 may be a transcript variant. CYP3A4 is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway and phase I oxidative metabolism of carcinogens, steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics, as well as bioactivation of aflatoxin B(1) to a genotoxic derivative. Activity/expression seems a key predictor of drug responsiveness and toxicity.
