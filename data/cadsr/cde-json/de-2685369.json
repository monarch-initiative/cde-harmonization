It also can be used to obtain blood samples. This device avoids the need for separate needle insertions for each infusion or blood test. Examples of these devices include Hickman catheters, which require clamps to make sure the valve is closed, and Groshong catheters, which have a valve that opens as fluid is withdrawn or infused and remains closed when not in use.:Medical device - any machinery designed to aid diagnostic and medical therapies. Medical device has to be designed with rigorous safety standards. There are several basic types of medical devices: life support equipment used to maintain a patient's body functions; therapeutic equipment; monitors and detectors to measure the indexes of a patient's state; imagine machines and laboratory equipment used with diagnostic and status monitoring purposes. In insurance parlance, the term is usually synonymous with assistive device, although it may include medical supplies.","longName":"C17612:C16830","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Central Venous Access Catheter","conceptCode":"C17612","definition":"A venous catheter positioned
