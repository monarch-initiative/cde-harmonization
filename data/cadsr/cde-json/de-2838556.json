Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"62A51A25-5607-CA49-E040-BB89AD435D3A","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-02-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2009-02-11","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2009-02-11","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2413363","version":"1","preferredName":"Exposure","preferredDefinition":"Contact with infectious agents (bacteria or viruses) in a manner that promotes transmission and increases the likelihood of disease.
