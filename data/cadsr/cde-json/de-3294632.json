It can be found in large concentrations within the liver, spinal cord, and brain. Cholesterol is an important component of the membranes of cells, providing stability. It is the major precursor for the synthesis of vitamin D, of the various steroid hormones, including cortisol, cortisone, and aldosterone in the adrenal glands, and of the sex hormones progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone.  Cholesterol also has an important role for the brain synapses as well as in the immune system.  In conditions featuring elevated low density lipoproteins (LDL), cholesterol often forms plaque deposits in the walls of arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Laboratory Procedure","conceptCode":"C25294","definition":"Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"32F3AEA1-B2FB-061B-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-06-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2007-06-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2007-06-15","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008557","version":"1","preferredName":"Lab Results","preferredDefinition":"the results of laboratory tests.","longName":"LAB_RESULTS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B2CFBA7D-D009-7227-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"NHLBI FBPP:Family Blood Pressure Program","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"32F3AEA1-B30C-061B-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-06-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2007-06-15","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":"5/21/14 unretired DEC as part of Rel CDE w Retired DEC review, associated CDE used by other context, added CDE CS/CSI.  jc  2/9/12 - Retired as part of content cleanup activities per concurrence with Jenny Larkin (NHLBI).  8/2/07-DEC released per FBPP review team direction.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2718235","version":"1","preferredName":"Lower Limit of Normal Value","preferredDefinition":"the value, units of measure not specified, of the lowest value of the range of statistical characteristics that represent accepted standard, non-pathological patterns, for a particular laboratory result or other quantitative parameter.","longName":"LLN_VAL","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"NUMBER","minLength":null,"maxLength":"8","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":"2","PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008557","version":"1","preferredName":"Lab Results","preferredDefinition":"the results of laboratory tests.","longName":"LAB_RESULTS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B2CFBA7D-D009-7227-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2718234","version":"1","preferredName":"LLN Value","preferredDefinition":"The bottom of the normal range for a particular laboratory result.:The information contained in a data field.","longName":"C25555:C49100","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Lower Limit of Normal","conceptCode":"C25555","definition":"The lowest value of the range of statistical characteristics that are supposed to represent accepted standard, non-pathological pattern for particular laboratory result or other quantitative parameter.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Data Value","conceptCode":"C49100","definition":"The information contained in a data field.
