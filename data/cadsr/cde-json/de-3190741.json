Proteolytic cleavage of the single chain protein at a centrally located arginine-isoleucine bond by plasmin gives rise to a 2-chain disulfide-linked form, composed of the N-terminally derived heavy chain and the C-terminal light chain.:Use of infusions of fibrinolytic agents to destroy or dissolve thrombi in blood vessels or bypass grafts.","longName":"C13346:C16995:C15338","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Intravenous","conceptCode":"C13346","definition":"Into or within a vein.
