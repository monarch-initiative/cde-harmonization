Cisplatin/carboplatin are   alkylating-like inorganic platinum agents (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) with antineoplastic activity.

Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.
