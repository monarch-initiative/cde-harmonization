A DXA scanner produces 2 X-ray beams, each with different energy levels. One beam is high energy while the other is low energy. The amount of x-rays that pass through the bone is measured for each beam. This will vary depending on the thickness of the bone. Based on the difference between the 2 beams, the bone density can be measured._A method to assess body composition, i.e., the relative percentages of body weight comprised of fat tissue and lean body mass.  It is based on the principle that the resistance to an applied electric current is inversely related to the amount of lean body mass within the body. Impedance is greatest in fat tissue, which contains only 10-20% water, while lean body mass, which contains 70-75% water, allows the signal to pass much more easily._A measure of the amount of minerals (mostly calcium and phosphorous) contained in a certain volume of bone. Bone mass measurements are used to diagnose osteoporosis (a condition marked by decreased bone mass), to see how well osteoporosis treatments are working, and to predict how likely the bones are to break.
