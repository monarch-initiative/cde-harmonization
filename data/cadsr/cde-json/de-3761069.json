{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3761069","version":"1","preferredName":"Observation Study Protocol Version Primary Purpose Type Code ISO21090.CD.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"An action plan of a pre-clinical or clinical study in which biomedical and/or health outcomes are assessed in pre-defined groups of study subjects or experimental units. Study subjects or experimental units in the study may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other interventions, but the investigator does not assign specific interventions to the study subjects or experimental units of the study. A coded value specifying the type of study based upon the intent of the study's activities. A classification of the intent of the study. EXAMPLE(S): (1) Treatment studies test new treatments, new combinations of drugs, or new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy. (2) Prevention studies seek better ways to prevent disease in those who have never had it or prevent recurrence; may include medicines, vitamins, vaccines, minerals, lifestyle changes. (3) Diagnostic studies seek better tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition. (4) Screening studies seek best way to detect diseases, health conditions. (5) Quality of Life (or Supportive Care) studies explore ways to improve comfort, quality of life for individuals with chronic illness. NOTE(S): StudyProtocolVersion.purposeStatement, StudyProtocolVersion.primaryPurposeTypeCode and StudyObjective may sound similar in meaning but are distinct concepts in BRIDG (see NOTES on StudyObjective).","longName":"3760286v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760286","version":"1","preferredName":"Observation Study Protocol
