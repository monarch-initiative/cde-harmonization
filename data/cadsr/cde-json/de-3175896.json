EXAMPLE(S): I, I/II, II, III, N/A. NOTE(S): Studies are categorized into four or five phases. An investigational medicine or product may be evaluated in two or more phases simultaneously in different studies; some studies may overlap two different phases. Phase 1 - initial introduction of investigational new drug into humans; typically closely monitored; may be conducted in subjects or normal volunteer subjects. Phase 2 - controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate effectiveness of drug for particular indication(s) in subjects with disease or condition under study and to determine common short-term side effects and risks. Phase 3 - expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials; performed after preliminary evidence suggests effectiveness of drug; intended to gather additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate overall benefit-risk relationship of drug and to provide adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3b - subcategory of phase 3 trials near time of approval to elicit additional findings. Phase 4 - concurrent with marketing approval, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may seek agreement from sponsor to conduct certain post-marketing studies to delineate additional information about drug's risks, benefits, and optimal use. Phase 5 - Post-marketing surveillance.","longName":"3174786v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3174786","version":"1","preferredName":"Study
