It is the most common malignant tumor in females. Risk factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens, contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation. The vast majority of breast carcinomas are adenocarcinomas (ductal or lobular). Breast carcinoma spreads by direct invasion, by the lymphatic route, and by the blood vessel route. The most common site of lymph node involvement is the axilla.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Biomarker","conceptCode":"C16342","definition":"A characteristic that can be objectively measured and serves as an indicator for normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, state of health or disease, the risk for disease development and/or prognosis, or responsiveness to a particular therapeutic intervention.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Group","conceptCode":"C43359","definition":"Any number of entities (members) considered as a unit.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"6C028E6E-6BCB-82B6-E040-BB89AD430FCA","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-06-10","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_IMAGEMINER","dateCreated":"2009-06-10","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2009-06-10","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2413239","version":"1","preferredName":"Protocol","preferredDefinition":"A protocol is a rule which guides how an activity should be performed;
