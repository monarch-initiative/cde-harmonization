As this type of response does not correspond exactly to an SDTM variable, CDASH recommends using the CDASHIG variable SUNCF. Sponsor must decide how to populate the appropriate relative timing variables when the SDTM-based datasets are created. For example, If SUNCF = \"Never\", the value of SUOCCUR will be \"N\" and all relative timing variables will be null. If the sponsor chooses to populate the relative start references (SUSTRTPT, SUSTRF) the value will be \"BEFORE\" when SUNCF= \"CURRENT\" and \"FORMER\". If the sponsor also chooses to use relative end references (SUENRF, SUENRTPT) , the SUENRTPT value will be \"ONGOING\" when SUNCF=\"CURRENT\" while the value of SUENRF will be \"DURING/AFTER\". Note: When using SUSTRTPT and/or SUENRTPT, these must refer to a \"time point anchor\" such as SCREENING in SUSTTPT/SUENTPT.","url":null,"context":"NCI Standards"},{"name":"CDASH PROMPT","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"Usage","url":null,"context":"NCI Standards"},{"name":"Theradex - 2","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"Has the participant ever used marijuana","url":null,"context":"Theradex"},{"name":"Theradex - 1","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"Has the participant ever used tobacco?","url":null,"context":"Theradex"},{"name":"Theradex - 3","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"Has the participant every used alcohol?","url":null,"context":"Theradex"}],"origin":"CDISC:Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Standard","id":"742D3B3D-030B-1F7D-E053-F662850AC2DA","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2018-08-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-08-24","modifiedBy":"KUMMEROA","dateModified":"2021-06-10","changeDescription":"Elevated to Standard per governance approval by RA. 2021-6-10 ak 6-18-20 tmt released for Theradex reuse. 8-24-18 Created as part of the CDISC mapping task; tt.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
