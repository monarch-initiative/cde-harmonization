The gel suppresses convective mixing of the fluid phase through which the electrophoresis takes place and contributes molecular sieving. For proteins, commonly carried out in the presence of the anionic detergent sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS). SDS denatures proteins so that noncovalently associating sub unit polypeptides migrate independently and by binding to the proteins confers a net negative charge roughly proportional to the chain weight.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"0FFEDB0F-A317-495E-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-03-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2006-03-27","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-03-27","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2261670","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessment","preferredDefinition":"Examination of the body by auscultation, palpation, percussion, inspection, and olfaction.
