It usually arises from the oral cavity, with approximately 60% of the cases involving the palate. The most common presenting sign is a painless mass in the palate. It is characterized by the presence of uniform, small to medium size malignant epithelial cells and an infiltrating pattern. There is a variety of morphologic patterns which may be present within an individual tumor, including lobular, papillary, papillary-cystic, cribriform, and trabecular pattern. It usually has a favorable clinical outcome and a low metastatic potential._A benign or malignant tissue growth resulting from uncontrolled cell proliferation. Benign neoplastic cells resemble normal cells without exhibiting significant cytologic atypia, while malignant cells exhibit overt signs such as dysplastic features, atypical mitotic figures, necrosis, nuclear pleomorphism, and anaplasia. Representative examples of benign neoplasms include papillomas, cystadenomas, and lipomas; malignant neoplasms include carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias._The degree of abnormality of cancer cells, a measure of differentiation, the extent to which cancer cells are similar in appearance and function to healthy cells of the same tissue type. The degree of differentiation often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis of disease.
