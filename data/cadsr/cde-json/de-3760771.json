NOTE(S): There are multiple ways in which an identifier can be associated to a product: inherited association to a material identifier, the association to a processed product identifier, and the association to product relationship identifier. If there is no context associated with the identifier, then the material identifier should be used. However, if the identifier for a product would be different in different context, one of the other identifiers should be used. If a kind of product is produced by different processors, and each processor assigns the product a different identifier, then the processed product identifier should be used. If the product is used in multiple assemblies, and in each assembly it would be assigned a different identifier, then product relationship identifier should be used.","longName":"3759997v1.0:2803193v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3759997","version":"1","preferredName":"Product Relationship Identifier","preferredDefinition":"The end result of a manufacturing process; anything that is produced.:A state of connectedness between people, objects, or events; to be associated or connected with something._One or more characters used to identify, name, or characterize the nature, properties, or contents of a thing.","longName":"3757173v1.0:2222848v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","ObjectClass":{"publicId":"3757173","version":"1","preferredName":"Product Relationship","preferredDefinition":"The end result of a manufacturing process; anything that is produced.:A state of connectedness between people, objects, or events; to be associated or connected with something.","longName":"C51980:C25648","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Product","conceptCode":"C51980","definition":"The end result of a manufacturing process; anything that is produced.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Relationship","conceptCode":"C25648","definition":"A state of connectedness between people, objects, or events; to be associated or connected with something.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"DCA1A324-EEF8-F781-E040-BB89AD4372DE","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2013-05-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_BRIDGPRD","dateCreated":"2013-05-13","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2013-05-13","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2222848","version":"1","preferredName":"Identifier","preferredDefinition":"One or more characters used to identify, name, or characterize the nature, properties, or contents of a thing.","longName":"C25364","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Identifier","conceptCode":"C25364","definition":"One or more characters used to identify, name, or characterize the nature, properties, or contents of a thing.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F62113C1-8528-4E73-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-02","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_EVS","dateCreated":"2005-05-02","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2222502","version":"1","preferredName":"UML DEFAULT CD","preferredDefinition":"Default Conceptual Domain for UML Loader","longName":"UML DEFAULT CD","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F5E53F3B-47A4-52D1-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2005-04-29","modifiedBy":"DWARZEL","dateModified":"2021-04-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"DCA3D85C-5982-664C-E040-BB89AD435461","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2013-05-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_BRIDGPRD","dateCreated":"2013-05-13","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2803193","version":"1","preferredName":"ISO21090.II.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"Identifier that uniquely identifies a thing or object.","longName":"2803193v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"ISO21090IIv1.0","minLength":null,"maxLength":null,"minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2846956","version":"1","preferredName":"ISO21090 Data Types","preferredDefinition":"Health Informatics -
