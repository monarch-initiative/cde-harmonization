Paraffin is also a technical name for an alkane in general, but in most cases it refers specifically to a linear, or normal alkane. It is mostly found as a white, odorless, tasteless, waxy solid, with a melting point between 47C and 65C. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in ether, benzene, and certain esters. Paraffin is unaffected by most common chemical reagents but oxidizes readily. (from Wikipedia):To surround a pathological or histological specimen with a firm and sometimes hard medium such as paraffin, wax, celloidin, or a resin, in order to make possible the cutting of thin sections for microscopic examination. (On-line Medical Dictionary):A colorless poisonous gas synthesized by the oxidation of methanol and used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, histologic fixative, and general-purpose chemical reagent for laboratory applications.  Formaldehyde is readily soluble in water and is commonly distributed as a 37% solution in water; formalin, a 10% solution of formaldehyde in water, is used as a disinfectant and to preserve biological specimens. Environmentally, formaldehyde may be found in the atmosphere, smoke from fires, automobile exhaust and cigarette smoke.  Small amounts are produced during normal metabolic processes in most organisms, including humans.
