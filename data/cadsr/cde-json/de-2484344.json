An assay that shows specific antigens by the use of markers that are either fluorescent dyes or enzymes. In these techniques an antibody is used to link a cellular antigen specifically to a stain that can be more readily seen with a microscope. Detection of antigens in tissues is known as immunohistochemistry, while detection in cultured cells is generally termed immunocytochemistry.","longName":"IHC_SC","context":"DCP","contextVersion":"1","ObjectClass":{"publicId":"2177103","version":"1","preferredName":"Immunohistochemistry","preferredDefinition":"Histochemical localization of immunoreactive substances using labeled antibodies as reagents.
