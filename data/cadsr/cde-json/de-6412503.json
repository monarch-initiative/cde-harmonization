If multiple races are collected, an alternate sponsor-defined variable structure would be required. Sponsors may record multiple self-reported races for a subject by appending a suffix to denote multiple collected races (e.g. CRACE1, CRACE2) and populate CRACE with the value MULTIPLE. If sponsors, choice to map the extended Race codelist values to the RACE CT (e.g. Japanese to Asian )- then this mapped variable would be reported using the SDTMIG variable RACE.
