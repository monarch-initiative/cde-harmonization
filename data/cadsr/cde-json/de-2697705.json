(MedicineNet.com):A method to assess body composition, i.e., the relative percentages of body weight comprised of fat and fat-free body tissue.  It is based on the principle that the resistance to an applied electric current is inversely related to the amount of fat-free mass within the body. Impedance is greatest in fat tissue, which contains only 10-20% water, while fat-free mass, which contains 70-75% water, allows the signal to pass much more easily.:No value exists.","longName":"C48789:C43545:CL196773","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Dual X-ray Absorptiometry","conceptCode":"C48789","definition":"A technique for scanning bone and measuring bone mineral density (BMD).
