Scans often used in diagnosing, staging, and monitoring disease include liver scans, bone scans, and computed tomography (CT) or computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. In liver scanning and bone scanning, radioactive substances that are injected into the bloodstream collect in these organs. A scanner that detects the radiation is used to create pictures. In CT scanning, an x-ray machine linked to a computer is used to produce detailed pictures of organs inside the body. MRI scans use a large magnet connected to a computer to create pictures of areas inside the body.","longName":"C71894:C17999","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Emission","conceptCode":"C71894","definition":"A substance that is emitted or released.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Scan","conceptCode":"C17999","definition":"The data or image obtained by gathering information with a sensing device.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"459B6193-A8E3-0231-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-02-07","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2008-02-07","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-02-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2733027","version":"1","preferredName":"Sweep Length","preferredDefinition":"A movement in an arc over a specified body part or area.:Length; the linear extent in space from one end to the other.","longName":"C72075:C25334","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Sweep","conceptCode":"C72075","definition":"A movement in an arc over a specified body part or area.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Length","conceptCode":"C25334","definition":"The linear extent in space from one end of something to the other end, or the extent of something from beginning to end.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"4793E26C-E460-31BE-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-03-03","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2008-03-03","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-03-03","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2233241","version":"1","preferredName":"Medical Imaging","preferredDefinition":"Events, people, materials and activities uniquely defined by medical imaging.
