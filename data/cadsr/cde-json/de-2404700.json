Less than 1 % of neoplasms are associated with these syndromes. An immune-mediated response to neoplasm-elaborated proteins may be the cause of these syndromes. Additionally, their manifestation may signal the presence of an occult neoplasm, potentially at an earlier stage of disease thereby leading to a better clinical outcome. Constitutional signs may include fever, night sweats, anorexia and cachexia. Clinical course is usually progressive. Prognosis is variable depending on the effective treatment of the underlying neoplasm.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Present","conceptCode":"C25626","definition":"Being or existing in a specified place or at the specified time.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"0094ACAF-11D4-1BCA-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-09-12","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-09-12","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-09-12","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008571","version":"1","preferredName":"Chronic or Associated Diseases and Exposures","preferredDefinition":"chronic diseases, as well as diseases and exposures associated with cancer.","longName":"CHR_O_ASS_DZ_AND_EXP","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B9B9249B-AB81-2F8D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-03-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-03-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"0094ACAF-11D5-1BCA-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-09-12","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-09-12","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2182309","version":"1","preferredName":"Chronic Associated Disease Exposure Specify","preferredDefinition":"the text field to specify chronic or associated diseases and exposures.","longName":"CHR_ASS_DZ_EXP_SPEC","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"CHARACTER","minLength":"1","maxLength":"100","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008571","version":"1","preferredName":"Chronic or Associated Diseases and Exposures","preferredDefinition":"chronic diseases, as well as diseases and exposures associated with cancer.","longName":"CHR_O_ASS_DZ_AND_EXP","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B9B9249B-AB81-2F8D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-03-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-03-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2184338","version":"1","preferredName":"Specify","preferredDefinition":"Specify;
