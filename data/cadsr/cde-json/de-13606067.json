A representative example of the latter is the metaplastic breast carcinoma in which the malignant glandular cells show squamous, spindle cell, or chondroid/osseous differentiation.","evsSource":"CTCAE_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"A6B8531E-1718-F891-E040-BB89AD4324F8","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-06-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2011-06-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"0C9197A7-8E47-0D22-E063-731AD00ADCA3","beginDate":"2023-12-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SOKKERL","dateCreated":"2023-12-15","modifiedBy":"SOKKERL","dateModified":"2023-12-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Metastasizing Chondroblastoma","valueDescription":null,"ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"13628955","version":"1","preferredName":"Metastasizing Chondroblastoma","longName":"13628955v1.00","preferredDefinition":"A rare chondroblastoma that has metastasized to another anatomic site.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Metastasizing Chondroblastoma","conceptCode":"C66799","definition":"A rare chondroblastoma that has metastasized to another anatomic site.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FC60B362-3476-4254-E053-731AD00A6D6A","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2023-05-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SOKKERL","dateCreated":"2023-05-23","modifiedBy":"SOKKERL","dateModified":"2023-05-23","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"0C9197A7-8E48-0D22-E063-731AD00ADCA3","beginDate":"2023-12-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SOKKERL","dateCreated":"2023-12-15","modifiedBy":"SOKKERL","dateModified":"2023-12-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Metastatic Carcinoma","valueDescription":null,"ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3421654","version":"1","preferredName":"Metastatic Carcinoma","longName":"3421654","preferredDefinition":"A carcinoma which has spread from the original site of growth to another anatomic site.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Metastatic Carcinoma","conceptCode":"C3482","definition":"Carcinoma that has spread from its original site of growth to other anatomic sites.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"BC2D2B8B-AE86-BC8B-E040-BB89AD430465","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2012-03-26","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2012-03-26","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"0C91A764-D324-0F6D-E063-731AD00A2AFC","beginDate":"2023-12-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SOKKERL","dateCreated":"2023-12-15","modifiedBy":"SOKKERL","dateModified":"2023-12-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Metastatic Pituitary Neuroendocrine Tumor","valueDescription":null,"ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"4722742","version":"1","preferredName":"Pituitary Gland Carcinoma","longName":"4722742","preferredDefinition":"A rare adenocarcinoma with poor prognosis, arising from the adenohypophysial cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland or pre-existing adenomas.
