Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic. (NCI04)_A small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase WEE1 with potential antineoplastic sensitizing activity. MK-1775 selectively targets and inhibits WEE1, a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDC2) to inactivate the CDC2/cyclin B complex. Inhibition of WEE1 activity prevents the phosphorylation of CDC2 and impairs the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. This may lead to apoptosis upon treatment with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Unlike normal cells, most p53 deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1 checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these cells rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells. Annulment of the G2 checkpoint may therefore make p53 deficient tumor cells more vulnerable to antineoplastic agents and enhance their cytotoxic effect._The act of having given something (e.g., a medication or test).","longName":"3186477v1.0:4722931v1.0","context":"Theradex","contextVersion":"1","ObjectClass":{"publicId":"3186477","version":"1","preferredName":"Combination Chemotherapy","preferredDefinition":"Treatment using more than one anticancer drug.","longName":"C191","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Combination Chemotherapy","conceptCode":"C191","definition":"Treatment using more than one anticancer drug.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"9AA6C034-CC59-60E3-E040-BB89AD430DF2","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-01-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ALAIS","dateCreated":"2011-01-25","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2011-01-25","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"4722931","version":"1","preferredName":"Most Recent Carboplatin WEE1 Inhibitor MK-1775 Administered","preferredDefinition":"Nearest to the present.:A second-generation platinum compound with a broad spectrum of antineoplastic properties.
