Fluorouracil and its metabolites possess a number of different mechanisms of action. In vivo, fluoruracil is converted to the active metabolite 5-fluoroxyuridine monophosphate (F-UMP); replacing uracil, F-UMP incorporates into RNA and inhibits RNA processing, thereby inhibiting cell growth. Another active metabolite, 5-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP), inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), one of the four nucleotide triphosphates used in the in vivo synthesis of DNA. Other fluorouracil metabolites incorporate into both RNA and DNA; incorporation into RNA results in major effects on both RNA processing and functions.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"4635B3FA-23D7-2C53-E053-F662850A76D9","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2017-01-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MORENOC","dateCreated":"2017-01-16","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"4635B3FA-23F0-2C53-E053-F662850A76D9","beginDate":"2017-01-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MORENOC","dateCreated":"2017-01-16","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2017-01-16","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine","valueDescription":"Oxaliplatin And Capecitabine","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"5628385","version":"1","preferredName":"Oxaliplatin And Capecitabine","longName":"5628385","preferredDefinition":"An organoplatinum complex in which the platinum atom is complexed with 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) and with an oxalate ligand as a 'leaving group.'

This activates and redirects CTLs to CD33-expressing tumor cells, which results in the CTL-mediated cell death of CD33-expressing tumor cells. CD33, a myeloid differentiation antigen, is expressed on normal non-pluripotent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and is overexpressed on a variety of cancer cell types, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It plays a key role in tumor initiation, proliferation and progression.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"0BD973DC-3440-5CA2-E063-731AD00AECED","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2023-12-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2023-12-06","modifiedBy":"KUMMEROA","dateModified":"2023-12-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"0BD973DC-3458-5CA2-E063-731AD00AECED","beginDate":"2023-12-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2023-12-06","modifiedBy":"KUMMEROA","dateModified":"2023-12-06","deletedIndicator":"No"}],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008538","version":"1","preferredName":"Therapies","preferredDefinition":"actions or administration of therapeutic agents to produce an effect that is intended to alter the course of a pathologic process (NCI).","longName":"TX","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B214D04D-9F05-1CA5-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-18","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2234813","version":"1","preferredName":"Type","preferredDefinition":"Type; a subdivision of a particular kind of thing.","longName":"C25284","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Type","conceptCode":"C25284","definition":"Something distinguishable as an identifiable class based on common qualities.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Standard","id":"F970CDF6-F90E-21D3-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-06-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-06-14","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-09-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"ECOG CRF:Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Case Report Form","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"BEA670A9-0FB6-0537-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-11-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CVALMONT","dateCreated":"2003-05-27","modifiedBy":"KUMMEROA","dateModified":"2023-12-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":"2023.12.6 PVs added per ticket request CADSR0003157. ak 11/21/23 4 PVs added for CCTG ticket number CADSR0003101 cjl; 2023.9.6 PVs added per ticket request CADSR0002816. ak 2023.3.22 PVs added per ticket request CADSR0002119. ak","unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ClassificationSchemes":[{"publicId":"2961451","version":"1","longName":"Children's Oncology Group (COG)","context":"COG","ClassificationSchemeItems":[{"publicId":"2961452","version":"1","longName":"Statistics and Data Center","context":"COG"}]}],"AlternateNames":[{"name":"COG","type":"USED_BY","context":"COG"}],"ReferenceDocuments":[{"name":"COG CRF Text 01","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"If Chemotherapy, type of chemotherapy received:","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"Type of chemotherapy received:","type":"Preferred Question Text","description":"Type of chemotherapy received:","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"COG CRF TEXT 2","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"Therapy type:","url":null,"context":"COG"}],"origin":"COG CRF:Children's Oncology Group Case Report Form","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"8488B7A1-8170-02B0-E053-F662850AFAA0","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2019-03-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COBARRUBIAK","dateCreated":"2019-03-20","modifiedBy":"LEEW","dateModified":"2022-03-25","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
