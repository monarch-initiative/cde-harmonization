In a minority of cases the tumor may metastasize to other anatomic sites including lymph nodes, lungs, liver, brain, and skeleton.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"8BD13A85-3BE6-7057-E040-BB89AD4314E1","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-07-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2010-07-20","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"A67A743F-612D-D6C3-E040-BB89AD436761","beginDate":"2011-06-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2011-06-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2011-06-24","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Actinic Keratosis","valueDescription":"Actinic (Solar) Keratosis","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2581230","version":"1","preferredName":"Actinic (Solar) Keratosis","longName":"2581230","preferredDefinition":"A precancerous lesion of the skin composed of atypical keratinocytes.
