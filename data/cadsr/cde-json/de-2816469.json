By blocking the targeted proteolysis normally performed by the proteasome, bortezomib disrupts various cell signaling pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. Specifically, the agent inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a protein that is constitutively activated in some cancers, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB-mediated cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. In vivo, bortezomib delays tumor growth and enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2C5DDD88-FA1B-F93D-E050-BB89AD437D4E","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2016-02-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2016-02-22","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"DD45FF9B-4819-1710-E053-4EBD850A1FA4","beginDate":"2022-04-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MALUMK","dateCreated":"2022-04-22","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2022-04-22","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Azathioprine","valueDescription":"Azathioprine","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3128751","version":"1","preferredName":"Azathioprine","longName":"3128751","preferredDefinition":"A purine analogue with cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activity.
