Conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been of limited value.  A KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (also known as STI-571 or Gleevec), is now effective in the treatment of relapsed and unresectable cases.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"9890B54F-84AF-2C65-E040-BB89AD4320B1","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-12-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2010-12-29","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-12-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"9890B54F-84C8-2C65-E040-BB89AD4320B1","beginDate":"2004-03-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2010-12-29","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-12-29","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Infantile fibrosarcoma","valueDescription":"Infantile Fibrosarcoma","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3179353","version":"1","preferredName":"Infantile Fibrosarcoma","longName":"3179353","preferredDefinition":"A fibrosarcoma, occurring in infants and young children, sharing identical morphologic features with adult fibrosarcoma.
