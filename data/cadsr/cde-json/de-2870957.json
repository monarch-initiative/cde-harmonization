EXAMPLE(S): The performed observation of \"WBC count\" would be associated to a clinical result called \"WBC result\" in which the results of the observation (13000 WBCs) would be stored. A coded value specifying the anatomic location that is the focus of an observation result. EXAMPLE(S): Arm for skin rash. NOTE(S): The target site of the result may be different than the target site of the activity (PerformedObservation) that generated it. A chest x-ray (observation) has the target site of chest while the result might show an infiltration in the left lower lobe of the lung (target site of result), or a dermatological exam may check the skin across the whole body (target site of observation) while the result might identify a rash on the right leg (target site of result).","longName":"2869280v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"2869280","version":"1","preferredName":"Clinical Performed Observation Outcome Target Anatomic Site Code","preferredDefinition":"Relating to the examination and treatment of patients dependent on direct observation.
