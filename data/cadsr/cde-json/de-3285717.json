To more easily handle these components a numeric code was assigned to each unique category for each T, N, M plus descriptors and AJCC stage for 6th and 7th editions. This field contains the numeric representation for the AJCC 6th edition 'T Descriptor' and is derived from CS coded fields using the CS algorithm. This numeric representation is referred to as the 'storage' code and its associated label is referred to as the 'display' code. Explanations of the 'storage' codes and their corresponding 'display' codes can be found in the most current version of the Collaborative Stage Data Collection System (http://cancerstaging.org/cstage/manuals.html). The display code should be used for display on the screen and in reports.","url":null,"context":"PS-CC"},{"name":"NAACCR 16, Data Stds/Dict.","type":"REFERENCE","description":"For additional details see NAACCR, Standards for Cancer Registries Volume II, Version 16 Data Standards and Data Dictionary (01/2016)","url":"https://www.naaccr.org/data-standards-data-dictionary/","context":"PS-CC"}],"origin":"NAACCR:North American Association of Central Cancer Registries","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"ADEE7AD5-2D4A-8C3A-E040-BB89AD434320","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-06-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CURTIST","dateCreated":"2011-09-27","modifiedBy":"HARTLEYG","dateModified":"2018-11-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
