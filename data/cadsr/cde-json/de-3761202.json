EXAMPLE(S): (1) randomization, direct assignment based on eligibility criteria, etc. (2) \"Escalating dose cohort studies\" enroll subjects in successive arms, i.e., one arm is completely filled before any subjects are enrolled in the next arm. In such a study, allocation depends on which arms have been fully enrolled and which are currently open for enrollment. Note that this example assumes that the experimental unit is the subject (rather than a part of a subject or a group of subjects). A ratio representing the number of occurrences of an activity within a given time period. EXAMPLE(S): Once per 12 hours, 2 times per day.","longName":"3760412v1.0:3152483v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760412","version":"1","preferredName":"Investigational Entity Allocation Administration Reuse Template Study Activity Repeat Frequency Ratio","preferredDefinition":"In the process of being studied;
