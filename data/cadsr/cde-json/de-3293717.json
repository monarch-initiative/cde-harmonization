Representative examples are lung squamous cell carcinoma, skin squamous cell carcinoma, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Not Otherwise Specified","conceptCode":"C19594","definition":"Not characterized in any other way.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"AF074E37-E704-1C17-E040-BB89AD431694","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-10-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2011-10-11","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"AF074E37-E71D-1C17-E040-BB89AD431694","beginDate":"2011-10-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2011-10-11","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2011-10-11","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Medullary carcinoma, NOS","valueDescription":"Medullary Carcinoma, Not Otherwise Specified","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3248489","version":"1","preferredName":"Medullary Carcinoma, Not Otherwise Specified","longName":"3248489","preferredDefinition":"A term referring to medullary carcinomas which can develop in various anatomic sites such as the thyroid gland, breast, colon, rectum, and small intestine.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Medullary Carcinoma, Not Otherwise Specified","conceptCode":"C66718","definition":"A term referring to medullary carcinomas which can develop in various anatomic sites such as the thyroid gland, breast, colon, rectum, and small intestine.","evsSource":"CTCAE_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"A6B8531E-173E-F891-E040-BB89AD4324F8","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-06-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2011-06-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"AF074E37-E731-1C17-E040-BB89AD431694","beginDate":"2011-10-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2011-10-11","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2011-10-11","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma","valueDescription":"Infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3293697","version":"1","preferredName":"Infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma","longName":"3293697v1.00","preferredDefinition":"An invasive ductal breast carcinoma associated with a lobular carcinomatous component.
