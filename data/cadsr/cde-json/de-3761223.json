{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3761223","version":"1","preferredName":"Study Protocol Document Version Confidentiality Code ISO21090.CD.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"A representation of a particular edition or snapshot of a document containing a study protocol as it exists at a particular point in time. EXAMPLE(S): Version 3 of a breast cancer protocol. OTHER NAME(S): Amendment NOTE(S): Term \"protocol\" is somewhat overloaded, must be qualified to provide semantic context, so \"study protocol\" chosen to disambiguate from other protocols. Notion includes (not limited to) design, statistical considerations, activities to test particular hypothesis/answer particular question that is basis of study, characteristics, specifications, objective(s), background, pre-study/study/post-study portions of plan (including design, methodology, statistical considerations, organization). Study protocol related to other supporting documents, including (not limited to) informed consent documents, case report forms, regulatory/approval documentation, correlative studies, etc. (via inherited association to DocumentVersionRelationship). Complete notion of study protocol represented by StudyProtocol, StudyProtocolVersion, StudyProtocolDocument, StudyProtocolDocumentVersion, StudyExecution and their associations. Term \"Amendment\" needs to be disambiguated since sometimes refers to amended version of protocol (StudyProtocolDocumentVersion), other times to summary of changes (AmendmentChangeSummaryVersion). A coded value specifying the degree of sensitivity associated with the document. EXAMPLE(S): Normal, Restricted, Very Restricted.","longName":"3760430v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760430","version":"1","preferredName":"Study Protocol Document Version Confidentiality Code","preferredDefinition":"The formal plan of an experiment or research activity, including the objective, rationale, design, materials and methods for the conduct of the study; intervention description, and method of data analysis.:An organized collection of records that describe a particular body of work.:A form or variant of a type or original; one of a sequence of copies of a program, each incorporating new modifications._Treatment of information so that it is not divulged in ways that are inconsistent with the understanding of the original disclosure.
