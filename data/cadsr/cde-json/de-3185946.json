{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3185946","version":"1","preferredName":"Stratification Criterion Observation Reuse Template Study Activity Foci Date and Time Range ISO21090.IVL.TS.DATETIME.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"An activity defined at a global library level that identifies pre-treatment factors by which study subjects are segregated to assure balance of these factors before randomization to a study arm or some smaller segment of a study. The decisive factor used to help segregate the study subject into a stratum group. The time period in which the observation result is held to be true, expressed either as a simple date range or as an evaluable expression that references a study-defined date or milestone. EXAMPLE(S): For a survey question, \"Have you traveled to Europe between 1990 and 1999?\", the focalDateRange would be \"January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1999\". For the question, \"Have you smoked in the last 2 months\", the focalDateRange would be an expression referencing a variable that represents the PerformedObservation.actualDateRange (a value yet to be defined) and a formula for the date range between when the question is asked (PerformedObservation.actualDateRange.low) and 2 months prior (PerformedObservation.actualDateRange.low - 2 months).","longName":"3174992v1.0:3152480v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3174992","version":"1","preferredName":"Stratification Criterion Observation
