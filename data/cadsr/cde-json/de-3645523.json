The ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 genes encode heregulin/neuregulin receptors, members of the EGFR-related type I receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily.  The encoded proteins form homo- and heterodimers, which complicates assignment of function: ERBB2 homodimers do not bind heregulin, but ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers do.  Herstatin is a secreted alternative ERBB2 product, of the extracellular domain, that binds to p185ERBB2, disrupts ERBB2 dimers, reduces p185 phosphorylation, and inhibits growth.  Human ERBB2 gene is located at 17p12-21.
