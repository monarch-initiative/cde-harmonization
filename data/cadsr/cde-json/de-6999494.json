The film upon which the cells are transferred is incorporated into the cap of a vial so that, when the transfer is done under a routine microscopic visualization, the microdissected material can immediately be put into a vial for processing. The system is integrated into a pathologist's microscope so that the cells are microdissected, transferred to the cap, and then rotated into a vial by a rotating arm in a hands-off operation.
