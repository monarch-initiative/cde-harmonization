{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3177084","version":"1","preferredName":"Intervention Trial Study Protocol Version Trial Phase Code ISO21090.CD.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"An action plan of a pre-clinical or clinical study in which individuals are assigned by an investigator based on a protocol to receive specific interventions. Study subjects may receive diagnostic, therapeutic or other types of interventions. The assignment of the intervention may or may not be random. The individuals are then followed and biomedical and/or health outcomes are assessed. A coded value specifying the designation of approval phase for a study. EXAMPLE(S): I, I/II, II, III, N/A. NOTE(S): Studies are categorized into four or five phases. An investigational medicine or product may be evaluated in two or more phases simultaneously in different studies; some studies may overlap two different phases. Phase 1 - initial introduction of investigational new drug into humans; typically closely monitored; may be conducted in subjects or normal volunteer subjects. Phase 2 - controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate effectiveness of drug for particular indication(s) in subjects with disease or condition under study and to determine common short-term side effects and risks. Phase 3 - expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials; performed after preliminary evidence suggests effectiveness of drug; intended to gather additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate overall benefit-risk relationship of drug and to provide adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3b - subcategory of phase 3 trials near time of approval to elicit additional findings. Phase 4 - concurrent with marketing approval, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may seek agreement from sponsor to conduct certain post-marketing studies to delineate additional information about drug's risks, benefits, and optimal use. Phase 5 - Post-marketing surveillance.","longName":"3175578v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3175578","version":"1","preferredName":"Intervention Trial Study Protocol Version Trial Phase Code","preferredDefinition":"A pre-clinical or clinical study in human beings in which individuals are assigned by an investigator based on a protocol to receive specific interventions.
