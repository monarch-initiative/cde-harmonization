When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F7C5DB4E-AC57-18B5-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-05-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"3162380","version":"1","preferredName":"Blood Glucose Measurement","preferredDefinition":"Blood circulating throughout the body.:A simple sugar monosaccharide having two isoforms, alpha and beta, with a chemical structure of C6H12O6 that acts as an energy source for both plants and animals by reacting with oxygen to form Carbon Dioxide and Water, releasing energy.(NCI):Measurement; the size or magnitude of something.","longName":"C12434:C2831:C25209","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Blood","conceptCode":"C12434","definition":"A liquid tissue; its major function is to transport oxygen throughout the body.
