The gene panel was selected and the Recurrence Score calculation was derived through extensive laboratory testing and multiple independent clinical development studies. Oncotype DX is validated for use in breast cancer patients whose disease is newly diagnosed, stage I or II, node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive and who will be treated with tamoxifen.
