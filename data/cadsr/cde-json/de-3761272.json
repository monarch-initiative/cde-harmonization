EXAMPLE(S): freezing, thawing, spinning, embedding, dividing, aliquot, adding additives or growth factors OTHER NAME(S): product manipulation NOTE(S): Material process may be performed on any kind of material, such as a specimen, nanomaterial, or biologic. The result of the process may a similar or different kind of material, for instance a specimen may be the result of a specimen processing step (e.g., aliquot or division of a specimen), or alternatively a blood product has anticoagulants added to it to preserve the product. Other processing steps, such as adding growth factor to induce cell growth, may be performed on the blood product. A coded value specifying the anatomic location that is the focus of a procedure. EXAMPLE(S): Kidney for a nephrectomy NOTE(S): Multiple contiguous sites within the same organ system may be referenced. Anatomic site and laterality both are included in this concept.","longName":"3760477v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760477","version":"1","preferredName":"Material Process Intervention or Procedure Reuse Template Study Activity Target Anatomic Site Code","preferredDefinition":"The tangible substance that goes into the makeup of a physical object.:A sequence of events which produces some outcome.:An activity that produces an effect, or that is intended to alter the course of a disease in a patient or population.
