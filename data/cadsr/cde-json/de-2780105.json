Among both males and females, it is the second most common visceral malignancy in the United States, with an expected 185,000 new cases each year.  It is considered as a disease of Western-world lifestyle.  Grossly, most colorectal carcinomas are either polypoid or of the ulcerative-infiltrating type.  Adenocarcinoma is the most common carcinoma in the colon and rectum.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma can be divided in three grades: Grade I (low grade or well-differentiated), grade II (average grade or moderately differentiated) and grade III (poorly differentiated).  The following histopathologic features have been shown to be prognostic indicators in multivariate analysis: microacinar versus macroacinar growth pattern, endocrine cells detected by chromogranin immunohistochemistry, Crohn's-like reaction and tumor budding.  The standard therapy for colorectal carcinoma is surgical resection.  The 5-year crude survival rate after curative resection for colorectal carcinomas ranges between 40% and 60% in most large series (Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology, 3rd ed., 1999)._Used for operative procedures on organs, regions, or tissues in the treatment of diseases, including tissue section by lasers.
