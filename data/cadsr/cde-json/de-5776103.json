Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"ACAAECCE-7A0E-657B-E034-0003BA0B1A09","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-10-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2002-10-29","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-03-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2593546","version":"1","preferredName":"Average Daily Use","preferredDefinition":"The central tendency of a set of n numbers; lacking special distinction, rank, or status; commonly encountered.:Occurring or done each day.:Use; put into service; make work or employ (something) for a particular purpose or for its inherent or natural purpose.","longName":"C37917:C25473:C25340","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Average","conceptCode":"C37917","definition":"A statistical calculation describing the central tendency of a set of numbers; used to interpret quantitative data.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Daily","conceptCode":"C25473","definition":"Occurring or done each day.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Use","conceptCode":"C25340","definition":"A manner, or usual, or accepted practice of using something.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"28BF7CAF-4261-5C1C-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-02-05","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ALAIS","dateCreated":"2007-02-05","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2007-02-05","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008571","version":"1","preferredName":"Chronic or Associated Diseases and Exposures","preferredDefinition":"chronic diseases, as well as diseases and exposures associated with cancer.","longName":"CHR_O_ASS_DZ_AND_EXP","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B9B9249B-AB81-2F8D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-03-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-03-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"97D99C19-F91F-972B-E040-BB89AD4351BE","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-12-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2010-12-20","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2201916","version":"1","preferredName":"Alcohol Lifetime History Indicator","preferredDefinition":"Response to a question about lifetime alcohol consumption.","longName":"ALC_LIFETIME_HX_IND","context":"DCP","contextVersion":"1","type":"Enumerated","dataType":"CHARACTER","minLength":"2","maxLength":"19","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[{"value":"Yes","valueDescription":"Yes","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2567168","version":"1","preferredName":"Yes","longName":"2567168","preferredDefinition":"The affirmative response to a question.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Yes","conceptCode":"C49488","definition":"The affirmative response to a question.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-D36D-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-11-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-11-13","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2024-01-02","changeDescription":"12/29/2006 -
