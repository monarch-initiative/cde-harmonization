It accounts for the greatest number of deaths from malignancies of the female genital tract and is the fifth leading cause of cancer fatalities in women.  It is predominantly a disease of older white women of northern European extraction, but it is seen in all ages and ethnic groups.  Adenocarcinomas constitute the vast majority of ovarian carcinomas.  The pattern of metastatic spread in ovarian carcinoma is similar regardless of the microscopic type.  The most common sites of involvement are the contralateral ovary, peritoneal cavity, para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes, and liver.  Lung and pleura are the most common sites of extra-abdominal spread.  The primary form of therapy is surgical.
