{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3760850","version":"1","preferredName":"Plan Composition Relationship Delay Quantity Range ISO21090.URG.PQ.TIME.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"A quantity of time falling within minimum and maximum bounds that specifies the elapsed time between when an activity is ready for execution and the actual beginning of the execution. EXAMPLE(S): Take a blood sample 15 minutes after administration of study drug or measure blood glucose 2 hours after each meal, the pause quantity would be 15 minutes and 2 hours respectively. NOTE(S): The pause quantity defines the amount of time between two points in time: (1) the point when all preceding steps (in sequence) and preconditions of an activity have been completed, and (2) the actual start of the activity. The completion of all pre-conditions and preceding steps (based on sequence number) indicates that an activity is \"ready for execution\" according to the definition above. The pause quantity counter or timeclock starts then, and when the full amount of time is reached, the activity begins. A pause quantity with a negative value means that the activity starts some amount of time prior to the estimated time that the activity is \"ready for execution\", i.e. prior to the estimated time that the pre-conditions and preceding steps will be completed.","longName":"3760069v1.0:3152486v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760069","version":"1","preferredName":"Plan Composition Relationship Delay
