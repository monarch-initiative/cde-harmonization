Cetuximab binds to the extracellular domain of the EGFR, thereby preventing the activation and subsequent dimerization of the receptor; the decrease in receptor activation and dimerization may result in an inhibition in signal transduction and anti-proliferative effects. This agent may inhibit EGFR-dependent primary tumor growth and metastasis. EGFR is overexpressed on the cell surfaces of various solid tumors.: A second-generation platinum compound with a broad spectrum of antineoplastic properties.  Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic. (NCI04): A compound extracted from the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia with antineoplastic activity.  Paclitaxel binds to tubulin and inhibits the disassembly of microtubules, thereby resulting in the inhibition of cell division.  This agent also induces apoptosis by binding to and blocking the function of the apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2 (B-cell Leukemia 2).
