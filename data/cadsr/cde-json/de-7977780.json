For example, if there is a large in situ component (e.g., 4 cm) and a small invasive component, see CS Site-Specific Factor 6 to code more information about the reported tumor size.  If the size of invasive component is not given, code the size of the entire tumor and record what the size value represents in CS Site-Specific Factor 6.
