The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-D3BA-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-11-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-11-14","modifiedBy":"COOPERM","dateModified":"2008-11-13","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"2454BCCB-0F4D-5496-E044-0003BA3F9857","beginDate":"2006-12-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-12-11","modifiedBy":"REEVESD","dateModified":"2006-12-11","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"14","valueDescription":"COLORECTAL","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2561511","version":"1","preferredName":"COLORECTAL","longName":"2561511v1.00","preferredDefinition":"Relating to the colon and rectum, or to the entire large bowel.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Colorectal","conceptCode":"C13363","definition":"Relating to the colon and rectum, or to the entire large bowel.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-BD54-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-07-05","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-07-05","modifiedBy":"KUMMEROA","dateModified":"2023-11-15","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"2454BCCB-0F59-5496-E044-0003BA3F9857","beginDate":"2006-12-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-12-11","modifiedBy":"REEVESD","dateModified":"2006-12-11","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"15","valueDescription":"Adrenal Gland","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2569663","version":"1","preferredName":"Adrenal Gland","longName":"2569663","preferredDefinition":"Paired glands situated in the retroperitoneal tissues at the superior pole of each kidney.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Adrenal Gland","conceptCode":"C12666","definition":"A flattened, roughly triangular body resting upon the upper end of each kidney; it is one of the ductless glands furnishing internal secretions (epinephrine and norepinephrine from the medulla and steroid hormones from the cortex).","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-DD2C-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2004-05-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PWEST","dateCreated":"2004-05-25","modifiedBy":"REEVESD","dateModified":"2010-03-09","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"2454BCCB-0F65-5496-E044-0003BA3F9857","beginDate":"2006-12-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-12-11","modifiedBy":"REEVESD","dateModified":"2006-12-11","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"16","valueDescription":"Heart","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2561096","version":"1","preferredName":"Heart","longName":"2561096","preferredDefinition":"A hollow muscular organ which receives the blood from the veins and propels it into the arteries.
