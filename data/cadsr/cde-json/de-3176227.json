A report typically includes causal association, management strategies, authorship, sender/receiver organizations, subject of adverse event, or name of product. EXAMPLE(S): An Expedited AE report - a report of a serious and unexpected adverse event that must be submitted within specific timeframes to the sponsor and regulatory agencies. A complete reference to a website (including http://) from which the document contents can be retrieved. EXAMPLE(S): In a Regulatory Product Submission (RPS) message, this identifies the file (with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)), which is part of the documentation. A URI is a compact string of characters used to identify or name a resource. The main purpose of this identification is to enable interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. URIs are defined in schemes defining a specific syntax and associated protocols.","longName":"3175070v1.0:2803208v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3175070","version":"1","preferredName":"Or Adverse Event Product Problem Safety Report Document Version Uniform Resource Locator","preferredDefinition":"An article used to connect words, phrases, or clauses representing alternatives; used to connect alternative terms for the same thing; used in correlation; used to correct or rephrase what was previously said; otherwise.:Any unfavorable or unintended symptom, sign, or disease including an abnormal laboratory finding) temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.
