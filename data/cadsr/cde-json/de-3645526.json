Although this term may be used to describe any therapy involving the use of chemical-based agents, it is most commonly used to refer to the variety of chemical-based agents employed to treat cancer.  Cancer chemotherapy works by arresting or killing the growth and spread of cancer cells.  Because cancer cells usually divide much faster than normal cells, they are often very sensitive to the inhibitory actions of chemotherapeutic agents.  Chemotherapy may also include agents that enhance immune function or alter hormonal activity. (NCI04):Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome, or disease, temporally associated with the use of a medical product or procedure, regardless of whether or not it is considered related to the product or procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). The concept refers to events that could be medical product related, dose related, route related, patient related, caused by an interaction with another therapy or procedure, or caused by opioid initiation or dose escalation. The term also is referred to as an adverse experience. The old term Side Effect is retired and should not be used.","longName":"C15632:C41331","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Chemotherapy","conceptCode":"C15632","definition":"The use of synthetic or naturally-occurring chemicals for the treatment of diseases.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Adverse Event","conceptCode":"C41331","definition":"Any unfavorable or unintended disease, sign, or symptom (including an abnormal laboratory finding) that is temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, and that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.
