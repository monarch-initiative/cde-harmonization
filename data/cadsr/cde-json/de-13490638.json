Lung carcinomas usually arise from the epithelium that lines the bronchial tree (bronchogenic carcinomas), and are classified as small cell or non-small cell carcinomas. Non-small cell lung carcinomas are usually adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, or large cell carcinomas. Metastatic carcinomas to the lung are also common, and can be difficult to distinguish from primary tumors.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Histologic Subtype","conceptCode":"C19790","definition":"The classification of tumors based on their histology.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Type","conceptCode":"C25284","definition":"Something distinguishable as an identifiable class based on common qualities.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FACEC96B-1E5F-17E3-E053-731AD00AF698","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2023-05-03","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2023-05-03","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2023-05-03","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FA6A6839-2DC7-2ABE-E053-731AD00A2A75","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2023-04-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2023-04-28","modifiedBy":"KUMMEROA","dateModified":"2023-08-28","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":"2023.8.28 Updated PV def for 'No Value Exists'. ak 05.15.23_Curated to support MILD_ghd","unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ClassificationSchemes":[{"publicId":"3533741","version":"1","longName":"NCORP (NCI Community Oncology Research Program","context":"NCIP","ClassificationSchemeItems":[{"publicId":"3533742","version":"1","longName":"Screening and Accrual Log","context":"NCIP"}]},{"publicId":"6705584","version":"1","longName":"CCG PTCL (Center for Cancer Genomics - Peripheral T Cell Lymphoma)","context":"NCIP","ClassificationSchemeItems":[{"publicId":"13461199","version":"1","longName":"MILD","context":"NCIP"}]}],"AlternateNames":[],"ReferenceDocuments":[{"name":"PQT","type":"Preferred Question Text","description":"Prevalent subtype of ADC or associated type for SCC","url":null,"context":"NCIP"}],"origin":"CCG:Center for Cancer Genomics","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FAD184F6-0517-1B54-E053-731AD00A550C","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2023-05-03","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2023-05-03","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2023-05-15","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":"05.15.23_Curated to support MILD_ghd","unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
