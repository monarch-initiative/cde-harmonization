If the patient has multiple tumors, all records should have the same code. Reference to Census 2000 definitions for ethnicity and race: http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf2.pdf  All information resources should be used to determine the correct code, including: Stated ethnicity in the medical record, Stated Hispanic origin on the death certificate, Birthplace, Information about life history and/or language spoken found during the abstracting process, Patient's last name [2230] or maiden name [2390] found on a list of Hispanic names. Some registries code the information from the medical record, others code ethnicity based on Spanish names, and others use a combination of methods. Persons of Spanish or Hispanic origin may be of any race, but these categories generally are not used for Native Americans, Filipinos, etc., who may have Spanish names. If a patient has an Hispanic name, but there is reason to believe they are not Hispanic (e.g., the patient is Filipino, or the patient is a woman known to be non-Hispanic who has a Hispanic married name), the code in this field should be 0 (non-Spanish, non-Hispanic). The code in item Computed Ethnicity [200], however, would reflect the Hispanic name.  Assign code 7 if Hispanic ethnicity is based strictly on a computer list or algorithm (unless contrary evidence is available) and also code in Computed Ethnicity [200].  See also Computed Ethnicity [200]. NAACCR recognizes that available definitions and abstracting instructions for Name--Last [2230] and Name--Maiden [2390] may be inadequate for describing names used in some cultures, including Hispanic cultures.  Explicit instructions have not been provided for entering compound names, with or without hyphens or \"De.\" Order of names, use of maternal and paternal names, and use of hyphens can vary across cultures.  It is likely that abstracting and coding practice for these items varies across registries. Limitations inherent in these definitions should be kept in mind when using the data.","url":null,"context":"PS-CC"},{"name":"Census 2000 Definitions for Ethnicity and Race","type":"VALID_VALUE_SOURCE","description":"Census 2000 Definitions for Ethnicity and Race","url":"http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf2.pdf","context":"PS-CC"},{"name":"NAACCR V11.2 Data Stds/Dict.","type":"REFERENCE","description":"For additional details see NAACCR, Standards for Cancer Registries Volume II, Version 11.2 Data Standards and Data Dictionary (5/30/2007)","url":"http://www.naaccr.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=PQdlAnykU1U%3d","context":"PS-CC"},{"name":"NAACCR V11.3 Data Stds/Dict.","type":"REFERENCE","description":"For additional details see NAACCR, Standards for Cancer Registries Volume II, Version 11.3 Data Standards and Data Dictionary (4/2008)","url":"http://www.naaccr.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=xSH32ZzIzGI%3d","context":"PS-CC"},{"name":"NAACCR 12.1, Data Stds/Dict.","type":"REFERENCE","description":"For additional details see NAACCR, Standards for Cancer Registries Volume II, Version 12.1 Data Standards and Data Dictionary (6/2010)","url":"http://www.naaccr.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=LJJNRVo4lT4%3d&tabid=133&mid=473","context":"PS-CC"},{"name":"NAACCR 16, Data Stds/Dict.","type":"REFERENCE","description":"For additional details see NAACCR, Standards for Cancer Registries Volume II, Version 16 Data Standards and Data Dictionary (01/2016)","url":"https://www.naaccr.org/data-standards-data-dictionary/","context":"PS-CC"}],"origin":"NAACCR:North American Association of Central Cancer Registries","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"33BDEF50-55E0-46B2-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-06-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2007-06-25","modifiedBy":"DWARZEL","dateModified":"2022-05-23","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
