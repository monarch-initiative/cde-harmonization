NOTE(S): A randomization book is a predefined set of assignments to portions of a study based on criteria, such as stratum group for example, that ensures a desired distribution of subjects across those portions of the study. For example, the book entries indicate which arm a given subject, Joe, is assigned to based on the fact that he's the 5th person in stratum group #2. The textual representation of the planned activity. EXAMPLE(S): In a migraine trial, the Wait activity may have a description of \"Wait until first grade 2 or 3 migraine\".","longName":"3175455v1.0:2803207v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3175455","version":"1","preferredName":"Book Randomization Allocation Plan Study Activity Description","preferredDefinition":"A volume made up of pages fastened along one edge and enclosed between protective covers.
