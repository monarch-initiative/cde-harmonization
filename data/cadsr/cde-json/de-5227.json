Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"ACAAECCE-7A0E-657B-E034-0003BA0B1A09","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-10-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2002-10-29","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-03-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2177321","version":"1","preferredName":"Use","preferredDefinition":"Use; put into service; make work or employ (something) for a particular purpose or for its inherent or natural purpose.","longName":"Use","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","Concepts":[{"longName":"Use","conceptCode":"C25340","definition":"A manner, or usual, or accepted practice of using something.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"AE29A78C-52CF-3A05-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-10-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2002-10-29","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-03-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008509","version":"2.31","preferredName":"SPOREs","preferredDefinition":"A Conceptual Domain to capture value meanings specfic to SPOREs not suitable for placement elsewhere.","longName":"SPORES","context":"SPOREs","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"DRAFT NEW","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"99BA9DC8-209A-4E69-E034-080020C9C0E0","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-02-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBR","dateCreated":"2002-02-13","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":"Changed name to match Context per Hvroje Med.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B78270E6-9FC3-20EF-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-02-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MEDVEDOH","dateCreated":"2003-02-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2018691","version":"1","preferredName":"Yes No Unknown Indicator","preferredDefinition":"Text terms to determine or aid in determining whether or not certain stated circumstances exist or criteria are satisfied.
