Upon ingestion, caffeine binds to adenosine receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), which inhibits adenosine binding. This inhibits the adenosine-mediated downregulation of CNS activity; thus, stimulating the activity of the medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers in the brain. This agent also promotes neurotransmitter release that further stimulates the CNS. The anti-inflammatory effects of caffeine are due the nonselective competitive inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Inhibition of PDEs raises the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP), activates protein kinase A, and inhibits leukotriene synthesis, which leads to reduced inflammation and innate immunity.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Intake","conceptCode":"C25538","definition":"The process of taking in a substance, especially by eating or drinking, or the quantities thereof; admittance of people to a place or organization at a particular time.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"7444F62F-4867-8B14-E040-BB89AD431BC0","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-09-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2009-09-23","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2009-09-23","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2183782","version":"1","preferredName":"NCIP","preferredDefinition":"Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid","longName":"NCIP","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"DACB2549-3BE3-73F7-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2004-05-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2004-05-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"7444F62F-4878-8B14-E040-BB89AD431BC0","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2009-09-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2009-09-23","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":" Changed from caBIG to PhenX for PANH by script 2015-12-21","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2944680","version":"1","preferredName":"Value in Milligram","preferredDefinition":"A numerical quantity measured or assigned or computed._A measure of weight.
