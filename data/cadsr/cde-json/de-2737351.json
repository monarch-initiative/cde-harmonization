Rare cases of solitary masses in the omentum or the mesentery have also been reported (extragastrointestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumor).  It is a tumor that differentiates along the lines of interstitial cells of Cajal.  Most cases contain KIT- or PDGFRA-activating mutations. Until recently, surgery has been the only effective therapy for this tumor.  However, many patients still experience recurrence.  Conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been of limited value.  A KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (also known as STI-571 or Gleevec), is now effective in the treatment of relapsed and unresectable cases.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Lesion","conceptCode":"C3824","definition":"A localized pathological or traumatic structural change, damage, deformity, or discontinuity of tissue, organ, or body part.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"496E96CC-E5D0-1791-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-03-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2008-03-27","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2008-03-31","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2459437","version":"1","preferredName":"Response","preferredDefinition":"In medicine, an improvement related to treatment.","longName":"C50995","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Disease Response","conceptCode":"C50995","definition":"The pathologic and/or clinical changes that result from treatment.
