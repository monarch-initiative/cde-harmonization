Ixazomib inhibits the activity of the proteasome, blocking the targeted proteolysis normally performed by the proteasome, which results in an accumulation of unwanted or misfolded proteins; disruption of various cell signaling pathways may follow, resulting in the induction of apoptosis. Compared to first generation PIs, second generation PIs may have an improved pharmacokinetic profile with increased potency and less toxicity. Proteasomes are large protease complexes that degrade unneeded or damaged proteins that have been ubiquinated.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"5D64DFD7-C3D9-166D-E053-F662850A1FF3","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2017-11-07","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2017-11-07","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"5D64DFD7-C3F2-166D-E053-F662850A1FF3","beginDate":"2017-11-07","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2017-11-07","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2017-11-07","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Nivolumab and Ipilimumab","valueDescription":"Ipilimumab and Nivolumab Regimen","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"6409150","version":"1","preferredName":"Ipilimumab and Nivolumab Regimen","longName":"6409150","preferredDefinition":"A regimen consisting of ipilimumab and nivolumab that can be used for the treatment of kidney cancer and melanoma.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Ipilimumab/Nivolumab Regimen","conceptCode":"C154272","definition":"A regimen consisting of ipilimumab and nivolumab that can be used for the treatment of bone cancer, kidney cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and malignant pleural/peritoneal mesothelioma.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"7409E9E8-661C-4EFE-E053-F662850A32CC","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2018-08-22","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2018-08-22","modifiedBy":"SOKKERL","dateModified":"2019-02-01","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"80DA679F-5630-273F-E053-F662850A2B0C","beginDate":"2019-02-01","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SOKKERL","dateCreated":"2019-02-01","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-02-01","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Nivolumab","valueDescription":"Nivolumab","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"5076694","version":"1","preferredName":"Nivolumab","longName":"5076694","preferredDefinition":"A fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1,PCD-1,) with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.
