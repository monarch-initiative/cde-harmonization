When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FCF89106-2131-2D93-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-07-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PWEST","dateCreated":"2005-07-29","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-07-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2321505","version":"1","preferredName":"Injection","preferredDefinition":"Use of a syringe and needle to push fluids or drugs into the body;
