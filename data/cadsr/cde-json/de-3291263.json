Breast carcinoma may affect both females and males.  It is the most common malignant tumor and the leading cause of carcinoma death in women.  Risk factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens, contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation.  The widespread use of mammography has contributed in the detection of very early cancerous lesions (less than 2mm in diameter).  The vast majority of breast carcinomas are adenocarcinomas (ductal or lobular).  Breast carcinoma spreads by direct invasion, by the lymphatic route, and by the blood vessel route.  The most common site of lymph node involvment is the axilla.  Breast carcinomas infrequently occur in males (particularly elderly individuals and patients with Klinefelter's syndrome).  The therapy of breat carcinoma includes surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, depending on the type and extend of the disease. --2002:Used for operative procedures on organs, regions, or tissues in the treatment of diseases, including tissue section by lasers.
