{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3761234","version":"1","preferredName":"Subject Activity Group Plan Study Activity Blinded Description ISO21090.ST.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"A collection of activities that are intended to occur or start for the same study subject at a specific point in the context of a particular study. EXAMPLE(S): (1) Clinic visit during which a physical exam, a blood test, and a substance administration occur (2) Telephone contact during which temperature, blood pressure and adverse events are reported (3) Recording multiple observation results in a diary (4) A treatment strategy that consists of drug administrations with rules for modifying doses OTHER NAME(S): visit, time point, study segment, course, treatment strategy, period, cycle The textual representation of the planned activity from the point of view of a blinded participant (study subject or study investigator). EXAMPLE(S): (1) During the second treatment epoch of a study, Arms A and B are still blinded and Arm C is no longer blinded. So, Arm A and B must have identical blindedDescriptions. (2) In a study with 3 arms, Arm 1: standard vaccine given in three shots at 2 months, 5 months, and 12 months of age; Arm 2: new vaccine given in three shots at 2 months, 5 months, and 12 months of age; Arm 3: new vaccine given in two shots at 2 months and 5 months of age. Subjects assigned to the third arm are unblinded at some point during 5 months and 12 months. By the time of the Third Shot Epoch, the \"Arm 3/Third Shot\" activity can be called by this, its unblinded name. However, the \"Arm 1/Third Shot\" and \"Arm2/Third Shot\" activities still need blinded names. Both these activities would have the blinded name (something like) \"3-shot Arm/Third Shot\".","longName":"3760440v1.0:2803207v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760440","version":"1","preferredName":"Subject Activity Group Plan Study Activity Blinded Description","preferredDefinition":"Some matter, situation, or event that is thought about, written about, or discussed.:An active process;
