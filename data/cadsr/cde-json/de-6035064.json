A Full DateTime would contain all the elements, YYYYMMDDhhmmss. Partial DateTime may be filled from the left, e.g., YYYY, YYYYMM, YYYYMMDD, YYYYMMDDhh, YYYYMMDDhhmm, YYYYMMDDhhmmss, etc. This business rule for reporting Partial DateTime is in agreement with the HL7 guidelines for exchange of DateTime information.
