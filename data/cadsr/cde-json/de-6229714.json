Risk factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens, contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation.  The widespread use of mammography has contributed in the detection of very early cancerous lesions (less than 2mm in diameter).

The most common site of lymph node involvment is the axilla.  Breast carcinomas infrequently occur in males (particularly elderly individuals and patients with Klinefelter's syndrome).
