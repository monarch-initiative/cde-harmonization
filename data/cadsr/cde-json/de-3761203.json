EXAMPLE(S): (1) randomization, direct assignment based on eligibility criteria, etc. (2) \"Escalating dose cohort studies\" enroll subjects in successive arms, i.e., one arm is completely filled before any subjects are enrolled in the next arm. In such a study, allocation depends on which arms have been fully enrolled and which are currently open for enrollment. Note that this example assumes that the experimental unit is the subject (rather than a part of a subject or a group of subjects). An integer falling within minimum and maximum bounds that specifies how many times the activity occurs. NOTE(S): If the frequency is more than once a day, this is still interpreted per time, e.g. BID for 5 days = 10 repeats.","longName":"3760413v1.0:3152485v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760413","version":"1","preferredName":"Investigational Entity Allocation
