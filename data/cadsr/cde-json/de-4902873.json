Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"05116195-EBA8-7341-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-11-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ALAIS","dateCreated":"2005-11-09","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-11-09","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008537","version":"1","preferredName":"Diagnosis","preferredDefinition":"the process of identifying a disease by the signs and symptoms (NCI Glossary).","longName":"DX","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B205508C-8324-69B0-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-17","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-17","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"10862ED1-DADF-3397-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-03-31","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-04-03","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"4902871","version":"1","preferredName":"Histologic Grade Type","preferredDefinition":"Something distinguishable as an identifiable class based on common qualities.","longName":"HISTGRDTYPE","context":"Alliance","contextVersion":"1","type":"Enumerated","dataType":"CHARACTER","minLength":null,"maxLength":"50","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[{"value":"Grade II or Grade III","valueDescription":"Grade 2 Or Grade 3","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"4902872","version":"1","preferredName":"Grade 2 Or Grade 3","longName":"4902872","preferredDefinition":"A morphologic qualifier indicating that a cancerous lesion is moderately differentiated.: An article used to connect words, phrases, or clauses representing alternatives;
