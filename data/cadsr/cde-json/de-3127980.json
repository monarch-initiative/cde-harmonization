Aromatase inhibitors belong to two classes: Type I steroidal drugs are androgen substrate analogues that bind competitively but irreversibly to the enzyme.  Type II nonsteroidal inhibitors fit into the substrate binding site and bind reversibly to the enzyme.  Present in many tissues, aromatases are heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the adrenal conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and the peripheral conversion (aromatization) of androgenic precursors to estrogens. (NCI04):Various treatment modalities that produce the desired therapeutic effect by means of change of hormone/hormones level. The treatment may include administration of hormones or hormone analogs to the patient, or decreasing the level of hormones in the body by using hormone antagonists, or hormone ablation therapy. The concept covers but not limited to: intermittent or permanent hormone suppression or ablation in treatment of hormone-dependent tumors, hormone replacement therapy of any kind, hormonal component of gender reassignment therapy, hormonal contraception, surgical and radiation castration.","longName":"C2140:C1740:C15445","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Adjuvant","conceptCode":"C2140","definition":"An agent that enhances the activity or therapeutic effect of another pharmacologic substance without having much, if any, therapeutic impact by itself.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Aromatase Inhibitor","conceptCode":"C1740","definition":"Any substance that inhibits aromatase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and the peripheral aromatization of androgenic precursors into estrogens.
