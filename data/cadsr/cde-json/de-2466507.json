Each Ig molecule is typically composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. Ig kappa light chains contain a variable and a constant region. Kappa light chains are encoded by multiple V, J, and C gene segments, which are separated in the genomes of cells undifferentiated with regard to antibody gene expression. Diversity in the kappa light chain V region arises during differentiation of an activated (kappa-type) antibody-producing B-cell from variable recombination of kappa V genes with kappa J genes and somatic point mutation, which plays a major role in antibody diversity.
