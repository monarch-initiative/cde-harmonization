G: Grade (cellular differentiation).","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"A6B8531E-166A-F891-E040-BB89AD4324F8","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-06-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2011-06-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"B8888943-DDC9-D8D0-E040-BB89AD437216","beginDate":"2012-02-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-02-09","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2012-02-09","deletedIndicator":"No"}],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008549","version":"1","preferredName":"Involvement and Extent of Disease","preferredDefinition":"indication of the presence and extent of disease.","longName":"INV_AND_EXT_OF_DZ","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B22AA815-A017-5261-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2538206","version":"1","preferredName":"Diseases and Disorders Stage Code","preferredDefinition":"A definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms.
