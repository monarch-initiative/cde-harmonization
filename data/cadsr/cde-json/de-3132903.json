Breast carcinoma may affect both females and males.  It is the most common malignant tumor and the leading cause of carcinoma death in women.  Risk factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens, contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation.  The widespread use of mammography has contributed in the detection of very early cancerous lesions (less than 2mm in diameter).  The vast majority of breast carcinomas are adenocarcinomas (ductal or lobular).  Breast carcinoma spreads by direct invasion, by the lymphatic route, and by the blood vessel route.  The most common site of lymph node involvment is the axilla.  Breast carcinomas infrequently occur in males (particularly elderly individuals and patients with Klinefelter's syndrome).  The therapy of breat carcinoma includes surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, depending on the type and extend of the disease. --2002:The ERBB2 Gene at 17q21.1 encodes ERRB2 Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase, a 185 kD type I membrane glycoprotein that controls cell growth with features similar to EGFR. Ligand binding increases phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. A potential heterodimer with ERBB3 and ERBB4 receptors, p185ERBB2 is an essential component of the heregulin/neuregulin receptor complex. ERBB2 homodimers do not bind heregulin but ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers do. Neuregulins do not interact with ERBB2 alone. The IL6 cytokine induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ERBB2 and ERBB3, but not EGFR. ERBB2 forms an IL6-dependent complex with the IL6R gp130 subunit resulting in MAPK activation. Expressed in fetal kidney and liver, herstatin is a 68 kD secreted product of an alternative ERBB2 transcript that retains int","longName":"3132900v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Metastatic","conceptCode":"C14174","definition":"A term referring to the clinical or pathologic observation of a tumor extension from its original site of growth to another anatomic site.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"5"},{"longName":"Breast Carcinoma","conceptCode":"C4872","definition":"A carcinoma arising from the breast, most commonly the terminal ductal-lobular unit.
