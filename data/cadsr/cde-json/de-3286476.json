To more easily handle these components a numeric code was assigned to each unique category for each T, N, M plus descriptors and AJCC stage for 6th and 7th editions. This field contains the numeric representation for the post-treatment AJCC 7th edition 'M' and is derived from CS coded fields using the CS algorithm. This numeric representation is referred to as the 'storage' code and its associated label is referred to as the 'display' code. Explanations of the 'storage' codes and their corresponding 'display' codes can be found in the most current version of the Collaborative Stage Data Collection System (http://cancerstaging.org/cstage/manuals.html).
