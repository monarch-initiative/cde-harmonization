When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Primary Neoplasm","conceptCode":"C8509","definition":"A tumor at the original site of origin.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F9FD4EEB-1DCF-0B27-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-06-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PWEST","dateCreated":"2005-06-27","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-06-27","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2240090","version":"1","preferredName":"uptake Result","preferredDefinition":"No value exists.:Outcome;
