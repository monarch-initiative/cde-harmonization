An abnormal kappa/lambda ratio by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting the presence of an abnormal clone is kappa/lambda of > 4:1 or < 1:2.).  Stringent complete response requires two consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of any new therapy, and no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed; radiographic studies are not required to satisfy stringent complete response requirements.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"3D3B8450-42AB-6519-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-10-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ALEYR","dateCreated":"2007-10-24","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"4A4DDB8E-9DBB-2B98-E053-F662850A5BE5","beginDate":"2017-03-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2017-03-09","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2017-03-09","deletedIndicator":"No"}],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008563","version":"1","preferredName":"Therapy Results","preferredDefinition":"the results or effects (does not include CTC Adverse Events) of therapeutic agents or procedures administered to the patient.","longName":"TX_RESULTS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B6690D31-4081-494A-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-01-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-02-11","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2234813","version":"1","preferredName":"Type","preferredDefinition":"Type; a subdivision of a particular kind of thing.","longName":"C25284","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Type","conceptCode":"C25284","definition":"Something distinguishable as an identifiable class based on common qualities.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Standard","id":"F970CDF6-F90E-21D3-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-06-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-06-14","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-09-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"4A4DDB8E-9D0D-2B98-E053-F662850A5BE5","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2017-03-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2017-03-09","modifiedBy":"COOPERM","dateModified":"2017-03-27","changeDescription":"Created for Myeloma project sponsored by the American Society of Hematology.  mc 3/9/17","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ClassificationSchemes":[],"AlternateNames":[],"ReferenceDocuments":[{"name":"Best Response to First Line o","type":"Preferred Question Text","description":"Best Response to First Line of Therapy","url":null,"context":"NCIP"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"4A503CF2-73D2-20FE-E053-F662850AF681","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2017-03-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2017-03-09","modifiedBy":"COOPERM","dateModified":"2017-03-27","changeDescription":"Created for Myeloma project sponsored by the American Society of Hematology. mc 3/7/17","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
