Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes which undergo proteolytic processing at conserved aspartic residues to produce 2 subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme. Caspase-3 is a central player in mediating apoptosis and is the most widely studied caspase. This protein cleaves and activates caspases 6, 7 and 9, and itself can be processed by caspases 8, 9 and 10. It is the predominant caspase involved in the cleavage of amyloid-beta 4A precursor protein, which is associated with neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease. Alternative splicing of the CASP3 gene results in two transcript variants which encode the same protein. (From LocusLink and NCI):An active process of selective destruction of differentiated cells in multicellular organisms, apoptosis is one of two mechanisms by which cell death occurs (the other being necrosis, a pathological process).  Important in ontogenesis, tumorigenesis, tissue turnover, lymphocyte selection and function, hormone-induced atrophy, etc., it serves as a balance to mitosis in regulating the size of animal tissues and in mediating pathologic processes associated with tumor growth.  Apoptosis is responsible for physiological deletion of cells and appears to be intrinsically programmed.  It is characterized by distinctive morphologic changes in the nucleus and cytoplasm, including chromatin cleavage at regularly spaced sites and endonucleolytic cleavage of genomic DNA (DNA fragmentation) at internucleosomal sites.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Caspase-3","conceptCode":"C18031","definition":"Caspase-3 (277 aa, ~31 kDa) is encoded by the human CASP3 gene.
