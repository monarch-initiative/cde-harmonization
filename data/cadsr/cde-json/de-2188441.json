The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-D3BA-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-11-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-11-14","modifiedBy":"COOPERM","dateModified":"2008-11-13","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"E3E5C03F-6DC7-2E8E-E034-0003BA3F9857","beginDate":"2004-05-12","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2004-09-15","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-03-29","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Rectum","valueDescription":"Rectum","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2567247","version":"1","preferredName":"Rectum","longName":"2567247","preferredDefinition":"The terminal portion of the gastrointestinal tract, extending from the rectosigmoid junction to the anal canal.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Rectum","conceptCode":"C12390","definition":"The terminal portion of the gastrointestinal tract, extending from the rectosigmoid junction to the anal canal.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-D3BC-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-11-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-11-14","modifiedBy":"CURTIST","dateModified":"2011-04-12","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"E3E5C03F-6DC8-2E8E-E034-0003BA3F9857","beginDate":"2002-02-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2004-09-15","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-06-22","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Sigmoid Colon","valueDescription":"Sigmoid Colon","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2581640","version":"1","preferredName":"Sigmoid Colon","longName":"2581640","preferredDefinition":"The portion of the colon that connects to the descending colon above and the rectum below.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Sigmoid Colon","conceptCode":"C12384","definition":"The portion of the colon that connects to the descending colon above and the rectum below.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE88-0BF5-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2004-05-10","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PWEST","dateCreated":"2004-05-10","modifiedBy":"FINCHAMB","dateModified":"2023-07-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"E3E5C03F-6DC9-2E8E-E034-0003BA3F9857","beginDate":"2002-02-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2004-09-15","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-03-29","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Spleen","valueDescription":"Spleen","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2567549","version":"1","preferredName":"Spleen","longName":"2567549","preferredDefinition":"An organ that produces lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys those that are aging.
