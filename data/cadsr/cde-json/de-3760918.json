{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3760918","version":"1","preferredName":"Clinical Performed Observation Outcome Target Biomarker Code ISO21090.CD.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"A coded value specifying a variation in cellular or biochemical components or processes, structures, or functions that is objectively measurable in a biological system and that characterizes normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, an organism's state of health or disease, likelihood of developing a disease, prognosis, or response to a particular therapeutic intervention. This is the focus of an observation. EXAMPLE(S): (1) Biomarkers include but are not limited to such phenotypic parameters as specific enzyme or hormone concentration, specific gene phenotype, presence or absence of biological substance. (2) For an observation with a name code of \"Determine the Allele for the HLA-A Locus on Chromosome 6\", the observation result might have a target biomarker code of \"HLA-A\" and a value of \"HLA-A*01:01:01\" (the specific allele) (3) For an observation with a name code of \"Determine the variant nucleotide for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism RS110789\", the observation result might have a target biomarker code of \"Rs110789\" and a value of \"C\" (cytosine, the specific nucleotide that is variant) OTHER NAME(S): Genetic Marker NOTE(S): (1) There is no associated 'approach' for a Biomarker, as there is for an anatomic site. In the context of Bone Marrow Transplantation, the bodily substance that is collected to determine the Biomarker (the HLA Alleles) is typically blood or saliva. Thus, the thing that is collected is the type code of the material that is collected via a performed specimen collection. (2) The attribute name 'target biomarker code' was chosen as inclusive of 'target genetic marker code', which is more specific to the Bone Marrow Transplantation domain. However, the Life Sciences Domain Analysis Model is using Biomarker as the focus of their Genomic Analysis, and thus this broader definition was chosen to facilitate that alignment.","longName":"3760143v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760143","version":"1","preferredName":"Clinical Performed Observation Outcome Target Biomarker Code","preferredDefinition":"Relating to the examination and treatment of patients dependent on direct observation.
