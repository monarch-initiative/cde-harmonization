When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F7C5DB4E-AC57-18B5-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-05-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2717429","version":"1","preferredName":"Insert Foley Catheter","preferredDefinition":"Something inserted or to be inserted.:A flexible plastic tube inserted into the bladder to provide continuous urinary drainage.
