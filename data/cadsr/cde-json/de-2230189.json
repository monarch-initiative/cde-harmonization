In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F726EBED-1EAA-2537-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-05-19","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2230186","version":"1","preferredName":"Interpretation Available","preferredDefinition":"An act or process of elucidation; explication, or explanation of the meaning of the event or thing via the assignment of objects from the domain to the constants of a formal language, truth-values to the proposition symbols, truth-functions to the connectives, other functions to the function symbols, and extensions to the predicates, if any.
