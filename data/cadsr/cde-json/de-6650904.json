It is also known as DCIS. There is no evidence of invasion of the basement membrane. Currently, it is classified into three categories: High-grade DCIS, intermediate-grade DCIS and low-grade DCIS. In this classification the DCIS grade is defined by a combination of nuclear grade, architectural growth pattern and presence of necrosis. The size of the lesion as well as the grade and the clearance margins play a major role in dictating the most appropriate therapy for DCIS.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"AAB50210-A094-7298-E040-BB89AD4308A3","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-08-17","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2011-08-17","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"D1028F32-B861-1F28-E053-4EBD850ADC34","beginDate":"2021-11-17","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COLBERTM","dateCreated":"2021-11-17","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2021-11-17","deletedIndicator":"No"}],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2435021","version":"1","preferredName":"Diagnostic or Prognostic Factor","preferredDefinition":"Top level term which includes Biological Markers, Risk Factors, and Prognostic Factors.","longName":"C20047","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"0741C99A-9B70-231B-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-12-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CURTIST","dateCreated":"2005-12-06","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2006-12-20","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"6753452","version":"1","preferredName":"Breast Histopathologic Examination Outcome","preferredDefinition":"One of two hemispheric projections of variable size situated in the subcutaneous layer over the pectoralis major muscle on either side of the chest.:The microscopic study of characteristic tissue abnormalities by employing various cytochemical and immunocytochemical stains.:The result of an action.","longName":"C12971:C18190:C20200","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Breast","conceptCode":"C12971","definition":"One of two hemispheric projections of variable size situated in the subcutaneous layer over the pectoralis major muscle on either side of the chest.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Histopathologic Examination","conceptCode":"C18190","definition":"The microscopic study of characteristic tissue abnormalities by employing various cytochemical and immunocytochemical stains.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Outcome","conceptCode":"C20200","definition":"The result of an action.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"88644BBB-8783-459D-E053-F662850A51D3","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2019-05-08","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KNABLEJ","dateCreated":"2019-05-08","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-05-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"MCL:Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screened Lesions","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Qualified","id":"82537DCF-C0E1-6679-E053-F662850ADFFD","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2019-02-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KNABLEJ","dateCreated":"2019-02-20","modifiedBy":"COLBERTM","dateModified":"2022-03-18","changeDescription":"3/18/22 mr Released per SME and DCT.   11/17/21 mr Added 3 PVs per MCL Breast PCA DCT.  2/20/19 jk created for MCL PCA Breast;
