To calculate the intensity, take the energy density (the energy per unit volume) and multiply it by the velocity at which the energy is moving. The resulting vector has the units of power divided by area (i.e. Watt/square meter).  Anything that can carry energy can have an intensity associated with it, but intensity is used most frequently with waves (i.e. sound or light).
