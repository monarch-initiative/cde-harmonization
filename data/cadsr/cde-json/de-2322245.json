[Explanatory comment: This identification number uses the accession.version format implemented by GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ in February 1999. (The unique identifier for a sequence record. An accession number applies to the complete record and is usually a combination of a letter(s) and numbers, such as a single letter followed by five digits (e.g., U12345) or two letters followed by six digits (e.g., AF123456). Some accessions might be longer, depending on the type of sequence record.) If there is any change to the sequence data (even a single base), the version number will be increased, e.g., U12345.1 â†’ U12345.2, but the accession portion will remain stable. The accession.version system of sequence identifiers runs parallel to the GI number system, i.e., when any change is made to a sequence, it receives a new GI number AND an increase to its version number. Whenever an individual searches an NCBI sequence database, only the most recent version of a record is retrieved.","longName":"2322233v1.0:2426010v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"2322233","version":"1","preferredName":"Gene Accession Number Versioned Genbank Accession Number Genomic Identifier","preferredDefinition":"A functional unit of heredity which occupies a specific position (locus) on a particular chromosome, is capable of reproducing itself exactly at each cell division, and directs the formation of a protein or other product.
