Cetuximab binds to and inhibits EGFRs, which are overexpressed on the cell surfaces of many types of tumors.  This agent blocks the tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis associated with the overexpression of cell-surface EGFRs. (NCI04):An inorganic platinum agent (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) with antineoplastic activity.  In the body, cisplatin forms highly reactive, charged, platinum complexes which bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as and DNA-protein cross-links. These cisplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. (NCI04):An antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the nucleoside pyrimidine with antineoplastic activity.  Fluorouracil and its metabolites possess a number of different mechanisms of action.  In vivo, fluoruracil is converted to the active metabolite 5-fluoroxyuridine monophosphate (F-UMP); replacing uracil, F-UMP incorporates into RNA and inhibits RNA processing, thereby inhibiting cell growth.  Another active metabolite, 5-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP), inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), a necessary constituent of DNA.  Other fluorouracil metabolites incorporate into both RNA and DNA; incorporation into RNA results in major effects on both the processing and functions of RNA. (NCI04):The use of synthetic or naturally-occurring chemicals for the treatment of diseases.  Although this term may be used to describe any therapy involving the use of chemical-based agents, it is most commonly used to refer to the variety of chemical-based agents employed to treat cancer.  Cancer chemotherapy works by arresting or killing the growth and spread of cancer cells.
