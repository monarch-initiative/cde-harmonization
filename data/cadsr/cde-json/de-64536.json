The disease may disseminate rapidly to various anatomic sites including the gastrointestinal tract, skin, testis, and cervical lymph nodes. It is also known as angiocentric T-cell lymphoma. The term \"polymorphic reticulosis\" has been widely used to describe the morphologic changes seen in this type of lymphoma. However, the latter term may also apply to lymphomatoid granulomatosis, which is an angiocentric and angiodestructive EBV positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-B29D-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-02-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBR","dateCreated":"2002-02-13","modifiedBy":"KUMMEROA","dateModified":"2023-10-03","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"BC9C8595-BC04-7351-E034-0003BA12F5E7","beginDate":"2002-02-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-05-01","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-03-29","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Extraosseous plasmacytoma","valueDescription":"EXTRAOSSEOUS PLASMACYTOMA","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2558769","version":"1","preferredName":"EXTRAOSSEOUS PLASMACYTOMA","longName":"2558769v1.00","preferredDefinition":"A localized malignant neoplasm arising in an extraosseous site.
