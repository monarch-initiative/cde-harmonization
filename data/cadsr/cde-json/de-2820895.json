Nicotine acts as an agonist at the nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the autonomic ganglia, at neuromuscular junctions, and in the adrenal medulla and the brain. Nicotine's CNS-stimulating activities may be mediated through the release of several neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, beta-endorphin, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and ACTH. As a result, peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure may be observed with nicotine intake. This agent may also stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone, thereby inducing nausea and vomiting.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Dependence","conceptCode":"C35458","definition":"The psychological or physiological need to take a substance in order to experience its effects or to avoid the effects of its absence.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"5F361546-D7FC-C79B-E040-BB89AD4369FD","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-12-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2008-12-29","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-12-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2190388","version":"1","preferredName":"Individuals","preferredDefinition":"the identification of individual people","longName":"INDIVIDUALS","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RETIRED ARCHIVED","registrationStatus":"Retired","id":"E799B454-C9F3-7079-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2004-10-29","endDate":"2006-02-21","createdBy":"ISHMUKHS","dateCreated":"2004-10-29","modifiedBy":"TAYLORT","dateModified":"2021-11-17","changeDescription":"11/17/21 changed WS from Retired Deleted to Retired Archived. 02/21/2006 Retired, revisions pending.
