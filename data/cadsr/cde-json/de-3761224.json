EXAMPLE(S): Version 3 of a breast cancer protocol. OTHER NAME(S): Amendment NOTE(S): Term \"protocol\" is somewhat overloaded, must be qualified to provide semantic context, so \"study protocol\" chosen to disambiguate from other protocols. Notion includes (not limited to) design, statistical considerations, activities to test particular hypothesis/answer particular question that is basis of study, characteristics, specifications, objective(s), background, pre-study/study/post-study portions of plan (including design, methodology, statistical considerations, organization). Study protocol related to other supporting documents, including (not limited to) informed consent documents, case report forms, regulatory/approval documentation, correlative studies, etc. (via inherited association to DocumentVersionRelationship). Complete notion of study protocol represented by StudyProtocol, StudyProtocolVersion, StudyProtocolDocument, StudyProtocolDocumentVersion, StudyExecution and their associations. Term \"Amendment\" needs to be disambiguated since sometimes refers to amended version of protocol (StudyProtocolDocumentVersion), other times to summary of changes (AmendmentChangeSummaryVersion). The date (and time) on which the document is versioned.","longName":"3760431v1.0:3148148v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760431","version":"1","preferredName":"Study Protocol Document Version Date and Time","preferredDefinition":"The formal plan of an experiment or research activity, including the objective, rationale, design, materials and methods for the conduct of the study;
