Upon administration, acetylcysteine exerts its mucolytic activity by reducing disulfide bonds in mucoproteins, resulting in liquification of mucus and reducing its viscosity. It is also used for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose as it can restore the depleted GSH reserves in the hepatocytes during the process of detoxification.  The antioxidant activity is attributed to the ability of GSH to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby preventing ROS-mediated cell damage, decreasing oxidative stress, protecting cells against the damaging effects of free radicals and preventing apoptosis in these cells. In addition, this may inhibit tumor cell proliferation, progression and survival, in susceptible tumor cells that rely on ROS-mediated signaling for their proliferation and malignant behavior. Under certain circumstances, acetylcysteine is able to induce apoptosis in susceptible cells, including certain tumor cells, via the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent pathway but not involving endoplasmic reticulum stress. Also, acetylcysteine may also be able to degrade Notch2, thereby preventing proliferation, migration, and invasion in Notch2-overexpressing glioblastoma cells.

DTD is over-expressed in many tumors relative to normal tissue, including lung, colon, breast and liver tumors.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B9078B1E-F7A5-89BB-E040-BB89AD432908","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2012-02-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-02-15","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"B9078B1E-F7BE-89BB-E040-BB89AD432908","beginDate":"2012-02-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-02-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2012-02-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Docetaxel/Doxorubicin","valueDescription":"Docetaxel/Doxorubicin","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3378927","version":"1","preferredName":"Docetaxel/Doxorubicin","longName":"3378927","preferredDefinition":"No Value Exists","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Docetaxel/Doxorubicin Regimen","conceptCode":"C11218","definition":"A regimen consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel that may be used in the treatment of breast cancer and anaplastic carcinoma.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B907F9D9-CC4B-F916-E040-BB89AD435222","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2012-02-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-02-15","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"B907F9D9-CC64-F916-E040-BB89AD435222","beginDate":"2012-02-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-02-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2012-02-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"EM-1421","valueDescription":"Terameprocol","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3378929","version":"1","preferredName":"Terameprocol","longName":"3378929","preferredDefinition":"A synthetic tetra-methylated derivative of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and transcriptional inhibitor with potential antiviral, antiangiogenic, and antineoplastic activities.

Because ongoing DNA synthesis is necessary for irinotecan to exert its cytotoxic effects, it is classified as an S-phase-specific agent.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE88-02EB-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-05-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2006-05-18","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-05-18","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"B915D7F9-572C-D77C-E040-BB89AD4330BD","beginDate":"2012-02-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-02-16","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2012-02-16","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"IL2/LAK","valueDescription":"Interleukin-2/Lymphokine-Activated Killer Cells","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3379097","version":"1","preferredName":"Interleukin-2/Lymphokine-Activated Killer Cells","longName":"3379097","preferredDefinition":"No Value Exists","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Interleukin-2/Lymphokine-Activated Killer Cells","conceptCode":"C10246","definition":"No Value Exists","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B915D7F9-5739-D77C-E040-BB89AD4330BD","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2012-02-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-02-16","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"B915D7F9-5752-D77C-E040-BB89AD4330BD","beginDate":"2012-02-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-02-16","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2012-02-16","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Id Lymph Skin test vaccine","valueDescription":"Skin Test Lymphoma Vaccine","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3379102","version":"1","preferredName":"Skin Test Lymphoma Vaccine","longName":"3379102","preferredDefinition":"A preparation of an antigenic component of an infectious agent that is administered to a patient in order to determine whether previous exposure to the agent has occurred, and/or to assess the integrity of the patient's cellular immune system.

IAPs are overexpressed by many cancer cell types, suppressing apoptosis by binding and inhibiting active caspases-3, -7 and -9 via their BIR (baculoviral lAP repeat) domains.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Xevinapant","conceptCode":"C90574","definition":"An orally available mimetic of the natural second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases (Smac) and inhibitor of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs), with potential immunomodulating, apoptotic-inducing, chemo-radio-sensitizing and antineoplastic activities. Upon oral administration,xevinapant targets and binds to the Smac binding groove on IAPs, including the direct caspase inhibitor X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), and the cellular IAPs 1 (c-IAP1) and 2 (c-IAP2). This inhibits the activities of these IAPs and promotes the induction of apoptosis. Additionally, as xevinapant inhibits the activity of IAPs, it may work synergistically with cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation to overcome tumor cell resistance to apoptosis. As IAPs regulate nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) signaling pathways, which drives the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, xevinapant may enhance anti-tumor immune responses when administered with certain immunomodulating agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. IAPs are overexpressed by many cancer cell types and suppress both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting active caspases via their baculoviral lAP repeat (BIR) domains. They contribute to chemo-radio-resistance of cancer cells to certain cytotoxic agents and radiation, promote tumor cell survival and are associated with poor prognosis in certain types of cancer. SMAC, a pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein, is an endogenous inhibitor of the IAPs family of cellular proteins.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"CC30A674-8D9E-B756-E040-BB89AD4314E4","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2012-10-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-10-16","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"CC30A674-8DB7-B756-E040-BB89AD4314E4","beginDate":"2012-10-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-10-16","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2012-10-16","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Anti-Endosialin Monoclonal Antibody MORAb-004","valueDescription":"Anti-Endosialin Monoclonal Antibody MORAb-004","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3614158","version":"1","preferredName":"Anti-Endosialin Monoclonal Antibody MORAb-004","longName":"3614158","preferredDefinition":"A humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against human endosialin/TEM1 (tumor endothelial marker;CD248) with potential anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities.

When reintroduced to the patient, these anti-K-RAS G12D mTCR-expressing PBLs target and bind to K-RAS G12D-overexpressing tumor cells, which results in both cytokine secretion, including interferon-gamma (IFN-g), and tumor cell lysis. K-RAS, a member of the RAS family of oncogenes, serves an important role in cell signaling, division and differentiation. Mutation of K-RAS may induce constitutive signal transduction leading to tumor cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"A23C8922-5102-26EF-E053-F662850A66F7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2020-04-01","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2020-04-01","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2020-04-01","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"A23C8922-511B-26EF-E053-F662850A66F7","beginDate":"2020-04-01","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2020-04-01","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2020-04-01","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Midostaurin","valueDescription":"Midostaurin","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"5805895","version":"1","preferredName":"Midostaurin","longName":"5805895","preferredDefinition":"A synthetic indolocarbazole multikinase inhibitor with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities.

Although the precise mechanism of action of timolol is not clearly established, timolol targets, binds to and inhibits beta adrenoceptors in the ciliary body of the eye which may decrease aqueous humor production.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"0EA05E61-C044-55F4-E063-731AD00A696E","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2024-01-10","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2024-01-10","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2024-01-10","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"0EA05E61-C055-55F4-E063-731AD00A696E","beginDate":"2024-01-10","endDate":null,"createdBy":"GDEEN","dateCreated":"2024-01-10","modifiedBy":"GDEEN","dateModified":"2024-01-10","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Docusate Sodium","valueDescription":null,"ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2576789","version":"1","preferredName":"Docusate Sodium","longName":"2576789","preferredDefinition":"No value exists.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Docusate Sodium","conceptCode":"C29000","definition":"The sodium salt of docusate, a dioctyl salt and an emollient laxative with stool-softening activity.

This may inactivate Akt (protein kinase B) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which may result in inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signal transduction pathway as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK-mediated pathway. This may lead to the induction of tumor cell apoptosis mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)/death receptor type 5 (DR5; TRAIL receptor 2) signaling in tumor cells. In addition, ONC206 targets and binds to ClpP and induces proteolysis. This may disrupt mitochondrial structure and function in tumor cells and lead to tumor cell death. DRD2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is overexpressed in various malignancies. It is activated by dopamine produced by the tumor cells or present in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and plays an important role in the pro-survival and stress signaling pathways.
