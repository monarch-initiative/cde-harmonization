{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3176424","version":"1","preferredName":"Observation Study Protocol Version Primary Purpose Code ISO21090.CD.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"An action plan of a pre-clinical or clinical study in which biomedical and/or health outcomes are assessed in pre-defined groups of individuals. Study subjects in the study may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other interventions, but the investigator does not assign specific interventions to the study subjects or experimental units of the study. A coded value specifying the type of study based upon the intent of the study's activities. EXAMPLE(S): Treatment studies test new treatments, new combinations of drugs, or new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy. Prevention studies look for better ways to prevent disease in people who have never had the disease or to prevent a disease from returning. These approaches may include medicines, vitamins, vaccines, minerals, or lifestyle changes. Diagnostic studies are conducted to find better tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition. Screening studies test the best way to detect certain diseases or health conditions. Quality of Life studies (or Supportive Care trials) explore ways to improve comfort and the quality of life for individuals with a chronic illness.","longName":"3175252v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3175252","version":"1","preferredName":"Observation Study Protocol Version
