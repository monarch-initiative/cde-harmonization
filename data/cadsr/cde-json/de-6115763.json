The degree of differentiation often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four degrees of severity.

Risk factors include country of birth, family history, menstrual and reproductive history, fibrocystic disease and epithelial hyperplasia, exogenous estrogens, contraceptive agents, and ionizing radiation.  The widespread use of mammography has contributed in the detection of very early cancerous lesions (less than 2mm in diameter).  The vast majority of breast carcinomas are adenocarcinomas (ductal or lobular).  Breast carcinoma spreads by direct invasion, by the lymphatic route, and by the blood vessel route.  The most common site of lymph node involvment is the axilla.  Breast carcinomas infrequently occur in males (particularly elderly individuals and patients with Klinefelter's syndrome).  The therapy of breat carcinoma includes surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and chemotherapy, depending on the type and extend of the disease. --2002","longName":"C4872","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Breast Carcinoma","conceptCode":"C4872","definition":"A carcinoma arising from the breast, most commonly the terminal ductal-lobular unit.
