If it is known at the time of data collection, the treatment name may be collected in DASCAT (with appropriate, but different than DACAT, grouping values). The value of DASCAT would apply to all measurements on that record when mapped to SDTM. If needed, the CDASH variable [DATESTCD]_DASCAT may be used to collect a category for each DATEST.
