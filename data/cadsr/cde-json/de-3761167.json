EXAMPLE(S): Dispensing a bottle of pills NOTE(S): The term \"study agent\" only pertains within the context of a given study. An integer falling within minimum and maximum bounds that specifies how many times the activity occurs. NOTE(S): If the frequency is more than once a day, this is still interpreted per time, e.g. BID for 5 days = 10
