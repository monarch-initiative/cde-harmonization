It also can be used to obtain blood samples. This device avoids the need for separate needle insertions for each infusion or blood test. Examples of these devices include Hickman catheters, which require clamps to make sure the valve is closed, and Groshong catheters, which have a valve that opens as fluid is withdrawn or infused and remains closed when not in use.:Medical device - any machinery designed to aid diagnostic and medical therapies. Medical device has to be designed with rigorous safety standards. There are several basic types of medical devices: life support equipment used to maintain a patient's body functions; therapeutic equipment; monitors and detectors to measure the indexes of a patient's state; imagine machines and laboratory equipment used with diagnostic and status monitoring purposes. In insurance parlance, the term is usually synonymous with assistive device, although it may include medical supplies.","longName":"C17612:C16830","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Central Venous Access Catheter","conceptCode":"C17612","definition":"A venous catheter positioned with the tip in the proximal third of the superior vena cava, the right atrium, or the inferior vena cava.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Medical Device","conceptCode":"C16830","definition":"Any physical object that is useful for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of disease or other conditions.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"3BAE9246-4A8A-1C30-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-10-04","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2007-10-04","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2007-10-04","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"3873572","version":"1","preferredName":"Lumen","preferredDefinition":"The cavity or channel within a tube or tubular organ such as a blood vessel or the intestine.","longName":"C94478","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Lumen","conceptCode":"C94478","definition":"The cavity or channel within a tube or tubular organ such as a blood vessel or the intestine.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"E580D969-25D0-6E19-E040-BB89AD432266","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2013-09-03","endDate":null,"createdBy":"WONGW","dateCreated":"2013-09-03","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2013-09-03","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2435020","version":"1","preferredName":"Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Research Equipment","preferredDefinition":"An object needed to perform a diagnostic, therapeutic or research activity.","longName":"C19238","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"0741AE5B-831F-25C7-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-12-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CURTIST","dateCreated":"2005-12-06","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2006-12-20","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"COG CRF:Children's Oncology Group Case Report Form","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"E57FC18A-F543-5D42-E040-BB89AD433835","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2013-09-03","endDate":null,"createdBy":"WONGW","dateCreated":"2013-09-03","modifiedBy":"MAESKEB","dateModified":"2019-10-21","changeDescription":" Changed from CTEP to COG for by script Thu Jan 2 10:00:57 EST 2014","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2526580","version":"1","preferredName":"Treatment Unit Count","preferredDefinition":"a numeric value quantifying stored containers of fluid or blood product for infusion into an individual at time of need.","longName":"TX_U_CT","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"NUMBER","minLength":"1","maxLength":"3","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":"0","PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008541","version":"1","preferredName":"Numbers","preferredDefinition":"the set of non-negative integers.","longName":"NUMS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B227CE66-2830-4A7B-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2459214","version":"1","preferredName":"Unit Count","preferredDefinition":"Any division of quantity accepted as a standard of measurement or exchange.:To determine the number or amount of something;
