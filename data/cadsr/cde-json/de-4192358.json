A 50-MHz wave is passed into the liver from a small transducer on the end of an ultrasound probe which measures the velocity of the shear wave (in meters per second) as this wave passes through the liver. The shear wave velocity can then be converted into liver stiffness. This technique is an alternative to liver biopsy.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"589BD1CD-9A00-6247-E053-F662850A5853","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2017-09-07","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PATELV","dateCreated":"2017-09-07","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"589BD1CD-9A19-6247-E053-F662850A5853","beginDate":"2017-09-07","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PATELV","dateCreated":"2017-09-07","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2017-09-07","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"MRI","valueDescription":"MRI","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2571738","version":"1","preferredName":"MRI","longName":"2571738","preferredDefinition":"Imaging that uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field rather than x-rays to provide amazingly clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues.
