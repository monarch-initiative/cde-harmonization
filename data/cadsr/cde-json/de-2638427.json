It focuses solely on family history to estimate the probability that a woman will develop breast cancer. Using this model requires providing information about first-degree and second-degree relatives who have had breast cancer. It factors in the ages at which these relatives were diagnosed. It can also include breast cancer history on the father's side of the family as well. It's main advantage is its expanded inclusion of family history information. It is limited in that it can be used only with women who have at least one first- or second-degree relative with breast cancer. Also, it does not take into account other risk factors such as the presence of atypical hyperplasia, age of first menstrual period, or age of first live birth.","longName":"C67371:C45991","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"BRCAPRO","conceptCode":"C67371","definition":"A statistical model used to assess the probability that an individual carries a germline deleterious mutation of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, based on family history of breast and ovarian cancer, including male breast cancer and bilateral synchronous and asynchronous diagnoses.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Claus Model","conceptCode":"C45991","definition":"The Claus model predicts the probability of a woman's risk for developing breast cancer based on her family history.
