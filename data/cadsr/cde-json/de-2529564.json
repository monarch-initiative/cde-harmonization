CGAP has two overall goals: 1. Enhance discovery of the acquired and inherited molecular changes in cancer. 2. Evaluate the clinical potential of these discoveries. This requires the creation and dissemination of technologies that can read and interpret the molecular features of cancer.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"DNA Library","conceptCode":"C16223","definition":"A collection of DNA molecules that have been cloned in vectors.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"207D3DF2-2EE4-3F6A-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-10-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CABIO","dateCreated":"2006-10-23","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2223270","version":"1","preferredName":"Keyword","preferredDefinition":"A small set of words designed to convey the subject of a technical article.","longName":"C43513","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Keyword","conceptCode":"C43513","definition":"A word or small set of words designed to convey the subject of a technical article.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F629FE21-888C-2122-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-02","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER","dateCreated":"2005-05-02","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2222502","version":"1","preferredName":"UML DEFAULT CD","preferredDefinition":"Default Conceptual Domain for UML Loader","longName":"UML DEFAULT CD","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F5E53F3B-47A4-52D1-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2005-04-29","modifiedBy":"DWARZEL","dateModified":"2021-04-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"207D4890-9941-4854-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-10-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CABIO","dateCreated":"2006-10-23","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2178533","version":"1","preferredName":"java.lang.String","preferredDefinition":"Generic value domain for a java datatype that is a class that represents character strings.","longName":"java.lang.String","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"java.lang.String","minLength":null,"maxLength":null,"minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2178532","version":"1","preferredName":"Bioinformatics","preferredDefinition":".","longName":"BIOINFORMATICS","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RETIRED ARCHIVED","registrationStatus":"Retired","id":"CD81DD3C-8FFA-28BA-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-12-02","endDate":"2020-10-14","createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-12-02","modifiedBy":"TAYLORT","dateModified":"2020-10-14","changeDescription":"10.14.20 TL changed WFS from DRAFT NEW to RETIRED ARCHIVED and added an End Date in preparation of OneData.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2234203","version":"1","preferredName":"Text","preferredDefinition":"Text;
