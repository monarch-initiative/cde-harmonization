Less than 1 % of neoplasms are associated with these syndromes. An immune-mediated response to neoplasm-elaborated proteins may be the cause of these syndromes. Additionally, their manifestation may signal the presence of an occult neoplasm, potentially at an earlier stage of disease thereby leading to a better clinical outcome. Constitutional signs may include fever, night sweats, anorexia and cachexia. Clinical course is usually progressive. Prognosis is variable depending on the effective treatment of the underlying neoplasm.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Present","conceptCode":"C25626","definition":"Being or existing in a specified place or at the
