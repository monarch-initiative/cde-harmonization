Alcohol acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, a diuretic, and a disinfectant. Although the exact mechanism of CNS depression is unknown, alcohol may act by inhibiting the opening of calcium channels, mediated by the binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) to GABA-A receptors, or through inhibitory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Alcohol inhibits the production of antidiuretic hormone, thereby producing diuresis that may lead to dehydration. This agent kills organisms by denaturing their proteins.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"5ECFF3E6-BD76-F78B-E040-BB89AD435BED","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-12-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2008-12-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-12-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2820799","version":"1","preferredName":"24 hours Maximum Consumption","preferredDefinition":"Vo value exists.:the largest possible quantity or degree.:The bodily process of taking in and using up something, especially the eating or drinking of something.","longName":"C0439584:C25564:C66715","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"24 hours","conceptCode":"C0439584","definition":"Vo value exists.","evsSource":"UMLS_CUI","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Maximum","conceptCode":"C25564","definition":"The largest possible quantity or degree.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Consumption","conceptCode":"C66715","definition":"The bodily process of taking in and using up something, especially the eating or drinking of something.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"5F32EE4D-10CC-2AF1-E040-BB89AD435998","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-12-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2008-12-29","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-12-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2435024","version":"1","preferredName":"Drug or Chemical","preferredDefinition":"A category of organic or inorganic substances, elements, and isotopes used in research or for the prevention, diagnosis, and/or treatment of disease states.
