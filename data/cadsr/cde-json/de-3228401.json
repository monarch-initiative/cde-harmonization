Germ cell tumors (GERMINOMA) of the testis constitute 95% of all testicular neoplasms._A malignant (clonal) hematologic disorder, involving hematopoietic stem cells and characterized by the presence of primitive or atypical myeloid or lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and the blood.  Leukemias are classified as acute or chronic based on the degree of cellular differentiation and the predominant cell type present.  Leukemia is usually associated with anemia, fever, hemorrhagic episodes and splenomegaly.  Common leukemias include acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Treatment is vital to patient survival; untreated, the natural course of acute leukemias is normally measured in weeks or months, while that of chronic leukemias is more often measured in months or years._Being or existing in a specified place or at the specified time._A myeloid or more commonly lymphoid leukemia (acute or chronic) affecting the testis.
