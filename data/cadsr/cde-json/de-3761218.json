NOTE(S): A randomization book is a predefined set of assignments to portions of a study based on criteria, such as stratum group for example, that ensures a desired distribution of experimental units across those portions of the study. For example, the book entries indicate which arm a given experimental unit, Joe, is assigned to based on the fact that he's the 5th person in stratum group #2. The relative timing for a planned activity expressed as the number of days offset from the study-defined reference activity (e.g., date of registration, start of treatment) for a particular subject, study subject or experimental unit.
