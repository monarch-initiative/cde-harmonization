EXAMPLE(S): freezing, thawing, spinning, embedding, dividing, aliquot, adding additives or growth factors OTHER NAME(S): product manipulation NOTE(S): Material process may be performed on any kind of material, such as specimen, nanomaterial, or biologic. The result of the process may be similar or different kind of material, e.g. specimen may be result of specimen processing step (aliquot or division of a specimen), or alternatively blood product has anticoagulants added to it to preserve product. Other processing steps, e.g. adding growth factor to induce cell growth, may be performed on blood product. An integer that identifies the particular occurrence of a repeating activity. The first repetition is defined as '1'. EXAMPLE(S): A planned activity might have a repeat quantity of 4 which would result in 4 scheduled activities with repetition numbers of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.","longName":"3760616v1.0:2848082v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760616","version":"1","preferredName":"Material Process Step Intervention or Procedure Performed Study Activity Repetition Number","preferredDefinition":"The tangible substance that goes into the makeup of a physical object.:A sequence of events which produces some outcome.:A specific stage of progression through a sequential process.:An activity that produces an effect, or that is intended to alter the course of a disease in a patient or population.
