Radiation may come from a machine outside the body (external-beam radiation therapy) or from materials called radioisotopes. Radioisotopes produce radiation and can be placed in or near the tumor or in the area near cancer cells. This type of radiation treatment is called internal radiation therapy, implant radiation, interstitial radiation, or brachytherapy. Systemic radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance, such as a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, that circulates throughout the body.","longName":"RT","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","Concepts":[{"longName":"Radiation Therapy","conceptCode":"C15313","definition":"Treatment of a disease by means of exposure of the target or the whole body to radiation.
