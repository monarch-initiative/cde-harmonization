The result is a reduction in DNA synthesis and cellular response to estrogen. In addition, tamoxifen up-regulates the production of transforming growth factor B (TGFb), a factor that inhibits tumor cell growth, and down-regulates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a factor that stimulates breast cancer cell growth. Tamoxifen also down-regulates protein kinase C (PKC) expression in a dose-dependant manner, inhibiting signal transduction and producing an antiproliferative effect in tumors such as malignant glioma and other cancers that overexpress PKC.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"3557625D-6251-3A11-E050-BB89AD435F94","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2016-06-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"HARTLEYG","dateCreated":"2016-06-15","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"3557625D-626A-3A11-E050-BB89AD435F94","beginDate":"2016-06-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"HARTLEYG","dateCreated":"2016-06-15","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2016-06-15","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Radiation or chemotherapy","valueDescription":"Radiation Therapy Or Chemotherapy","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"5294356","version":"1","preferredName":"Radiation Therapy Or Chemotherapy","longName":"5294356","preferredDefinition":"Treatment of a disease by means of exposure of the target or the whole body to radiation.
