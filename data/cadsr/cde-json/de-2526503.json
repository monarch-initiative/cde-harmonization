Lorazepam enhances the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid on the GABA receptors by binding to a site that is distinct from the GABA binding site in the central nervous system. This leads to an increase in chloride channel opening events, a facilitation of chloride ion conductance, membrane hyperpolarization, and eventually inhibition of the transmission of nerve signals, thereby decreasing nervous excitation.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"1F75B055-70AA-5C65-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-10-10","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2006-10-10","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-10-10","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2415348","version":"1","preferredName":"Indicator","preferredDefinition":"An event, entity or condition that typically characterizes a prescribed environment or situation.
