Glandular or tubular structures are absent.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE88-0A07-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-10-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2005-11-23","modifiedBy":"DWARZEL","dateModified":"2006-10-09","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"4662B5DF-F848-5F6D-E053-F662850A8EDD","beginDate":"2017-01-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2017-01-18","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2017-01-18","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"1","valueDescription":"Adenoid Cystic Breast Carcinoma","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2581151","version":"1","preferredName":"Adenoid Cystic Breast Carcinoma","longName":"2581151","preferredDefinition":"An adenoid cystic carcinoma primarily involving the breast.
