A defined activity is a \"kind of\" activity rather than an \"instance of\" an activity. EXAMPLE(S): Standard blood chemistries are frequently included in studies - also activities that are study-specific and recur more than one time in more than one arm may be defined, such as a substance administration activity involving X amount of drug Y. A coded value specifying the motivation, cause, or rationale of an activity.
