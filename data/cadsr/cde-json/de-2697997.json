The value is calculated by applying a CRC algorithm to all data fields of the NAACCR record (excluding the CRC CHECKSUM field). Following a transmission, the CRC CHECKSUM can be recalculated and compared with the transmitted CHECKSUM. Identical values indicate an error-free transmission; differing values indicate an error in transmission. The algorithm recommended by NAACCR is on the NAACCR website at: http://www.naaccr.org.
