{"DataElement":{"publicId":"5654651","version":"1","preferredName":"Post Transplant Allograft Rejection Pathway Occurrence Yes No Indicator","preferredDefinition":"The yes/no indicator for whether the following pathways take place after organ transplant: after transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.","longName":"POST_TRANSPLN_ALLOG_REJECT_IND","context":"DCP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"5654636","version":"1","preferredName":"Post Transplant Allograft Rejection Pathway Occurrence","preferredDefinition":"Happening at a time subsequent to a reference time; later in time or order._Used with organs, tissues, or cells for transplantation from one site to another within the same subject, or from one subject to another of the same species or different species._After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation.
