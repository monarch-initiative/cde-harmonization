Hemophilia is typically a hereditary disorder but, rarely, may be acquired. Inherited coagulation factor-deficient hemophilias include hemophilia A or classic hemophilia (hereditary factor VIII deficiency) hemophilia B or Christmas disease (hereditary factor IX deficiency), and hemophilia C (hereditary factor XI deficiency). Factor VIII inhibitors may occur spontaneously as autoantibodies, resulting in acquired hemophilia known as acquired factor VIII deficiency. Approximately 10% of patients with acquired hemophilia have an underlying malignancy.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"01D4D496-BB15-3A9F-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-09-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2005-09-28","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-09-28","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"6706546","version":"1","preferredName":"Hemorrhage Log","preferredDefinition":"The flow of blood from a ruptured blood vessel.:A written record of events.","longName":"C26791:C45279","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Hemorrhage","conceptCode":"C26791","definition":"The flow of blood from a ruptured blood vessel.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Log","conceptCode":"C45279","definition":"A written record of events.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"86ED4C82-1773-4BF8-E053-F662850A76A2","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2019-04-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2019-04-19","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-04-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008551","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessments","preferredDefinition":"evaluations of the patient and the patient's disease.","longName":"ASSESS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B22DA727-6718-5A2D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"Atrazine Exposure Study, Vacuum Cleaner Dust Collection Protocol, 2001","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"86ED4C82-1784-4BF8-E053-F662850A76A2","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2019-04-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PANH","dateCreated":"2019-04-19","modifiedBy":"PANH","dateModified":"2019-08-02","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2018321","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessment Text","preferredDefinition":"a free text field to specify information on the evaluations of the patient and the patient's disease","longName":"ASSESS_TXT","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"CHARACTER","minLength":null,"maxLength":"100","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008551","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessments","preferredDefinition":"evaluations of the patient and the patient's disease.","longName":"ASSESS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B22DA727-6718-5A2D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2184342","version":"1","preferredName":"Text","preferredDefinition":"Text;
