SDS denatures proteins so that noncovalently associating sub unit polypeptides migrate independently and by binding to the proteins confers a net negative charge roughly proportional to the chain weight.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"105FFAF1-FEA8-5B40-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-04-01","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2006-04-01","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-04-01","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2261670","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessment","preferredDefinition":"Examination of the body by auscultation, palpation, percussion, inspection, and olfaction.
