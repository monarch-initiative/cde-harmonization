In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F7C5DB4E-AC57-18B5-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-05-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"3141293","version":"1","preferredName":"Rescale Slope","preferredDefinition":"To establish something relative to a new reference scale.:The property possessed by a line or surface that departs from the horizontal; the tangent of the angle it forms with the positive X axis.","longName":"C92210:C70744","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Rescale","conceptCode":"C92210","definition":"To establish something relative to a new reference scale.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Slope","conceptCode":"C70744","definition":"The property possessed by a line or surface that departs from the horizontal; the tangent of the angle it forms with the positive X axis.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"90F18FA8-4DCB-4F68-E040-BB89AD433828","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-09-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2010-09-23","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-09-23","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2233241","version":"1","preferredName":"Medical Imaging","preferredDefinition":"Events, people, materials and activities uniquely defined by medical imaging.
