The gene is not expressed in mitotically quiescent cells, except in the stomach where it controls the synthesis and release of digestive enzymes and gastric acid. EGFR tyrosine kinase activity is required for internalization or degradation of EGF-EGFR receptor complexes. EGFR signaling involves small RHO GTPases and EGFR trafficking involves small RAB GTPases.","longName":"C17757","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"EGFR Gene","conceptCode":"C17757","definition":"This gene is involved in the epidermal growth factor signal transduction pathway.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FAB2D8EC-6CE2-68CB-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-07-07","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2005-07-07","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-07-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2240798","version":"1","preferredName":"CA Repeat","preferredDefinition":"A dinucleotide repeat consisting of (CA/GT)n.","longName":"C45810","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"CA Repeat","conceptCode":"C45810","definition":"A dinucleotide repeat consisting of (CA/GT)n.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FAB2D8EC-6CE5-68CB-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-07-07","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2005-07-07","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-07-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008557","version":"1","preferredName":"Lab Results","preferredDefinition":"the results of laboratory tests.","longName":"LAB_RESULTS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B2CFBA7D-D009-7227-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"FAB2D8EC-6CE6-68CB-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-07-07","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2005-07-07","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2240789","version":"1","preferredName":"Non-Negative Integer Number","preferredDefinition":"An integer with a value greater than zero.","longName":"NON-NEG_INTGR_NUM","context":"DCP","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"NUMBER","minLength":null,"maxLength":"7","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008557","version":"1","preferredName":"Lab Results","preferredDefinition":"the results of laboratory tests.","longName":"LAB_RESULTS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B2CFBA7D-D009-7227-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2233101","version":"1","preferredName":"Number","preferredDefinition":"Number;
