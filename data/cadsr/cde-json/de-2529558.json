CGAP has two overall goals: 1. Enhance discovery of the acquired and inherited molecular changes in cancer. 2. Evaluate the clinical potential of these discoveries. This requires the creation and dissemination of technologies that can read and interpret the molecular features of cancer.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"DNA Library","conceptCode":"C16223","definition":"A collection of DNA molecules that have been cloned
