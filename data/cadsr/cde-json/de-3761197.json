EXAMPLE(S): (1) randomization, direct assignment based on eligibility criteria, etc. (2) \"Escalating dose cohort studies\" enroll subjects in successive arms, i.e., one arm is completely filled before any subjects are enrolled in the next arm. In such a study, allocation depends on which arms have been fully enrolled and which are currently open for enrollment. Note that this example assumes that the experimental unit is the subject (rather than a part of a subject or a group of subjects). A coded value specifying a classification of activities. EXAMPLE(S): (1) In the case where category code = \"anti-cancer treatment\", the subcategory code may = \"radiotherapy\", and the name code may = \"external beam radiotherapy\". (2) In a procedure, category code may = \"abdominal surgery\". (3) In an administrative activity, the category code may = \"Disposition\" (off study, epoch completion), \"Milestone\" (informed consent, enrollment, registry, randomization) or \"Other\" (unblinding) activities. (4) For lab procedures, category code may = \"hematology\", \"urinalysis\", or \"chemistry\".","longName":"3760407v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760407","version":"1","preferredName":"Investigational Entity Allocation
