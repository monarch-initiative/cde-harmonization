The prognosis depends on the stage of the tumor, the depth of myometrial wall invasion, and the degree of differentiation.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Other","conceptCode":"C17649","definition":"Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Variation","conceptCode":"C25713","definition":"An alteration or difference from a norm or standard.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"956FE712-DE75-0EBA-E053-F662850A907E","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2019-10-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"HARTLEYG","dateCreated":"2019-10-21","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-10-21","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"956FE712-DE8E-0EBA-E053-F662850A907E","beginDate":"2019-10-21","endDate":null,"createdBy":"HARTLEYG","dateCreated":"2019-10-21","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2019-10-21","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma","valueDescription":"Biphenotypic Sinonasal Sarcoma","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"6943208","version":"1","preferredName":"Biphenotypic Sinonasal Sarcoma","longName":"6943208","preferredDefinition":"A rare, slow-growing, low-grade soft tissue sarcoma arising from the sinonasal tract.
