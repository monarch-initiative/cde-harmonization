They are short-lived cells resembling bursa-derived lymphocytes of birds in their production of immunoglobulin upon appropriate stimulation.:Expressed on early B-cells by human CD19 Gene (Ig Superfamily), 95-kDa CD19_Antigen is a type I cell surface protein with 2 extracellular IgC2 domains, a cytoplasmic tail with 9 conserved Tyr residues, and no significant homology with other known proteins. Assembled with BCR, CD19 decreases the threshold for antigen receptor-dependent stimulation of B lymphocyte proliferation and intersects with many intracellular signaling pathways. CD19 functions as an adaptor protein for Src family kinase amplification, crucial for antigen receptor-induced signal transduction. Following BCR/CD19 ligation, LYN (Src kinase) phosphorylates CD19-Y513, binds to the CD19-SH2 domain and phosphorylates CD19-Y482. CD19-pY482 recruits more LYN, leading to LYN phosphorylation and CD19-Y391 phosphorylation. CD19-pY391 recruits VAV, phosphorylated by LYN.
