If the calculation algorithm is not called at the time of the initial abstracting, the CS Version 1st could also be entered manually by the abstractor. It is not expected that this field would be updated every time a coded value is changed. However, the field should be available for future updating if, for example, the CS fields for certain records were to be systematically recoded for a special study using a later version, the CS Version 1st could be appropriately updated with the new version. The meaning and interpretation of CS Version 1st will be dependent on vendor implementation and local practices.
