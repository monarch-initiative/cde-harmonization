{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3176268","version":"1","preferredName":"Study Protocol Document Version Uniform Resource Locator ISO21090.TEL.URL.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"A representation of a particular edition or snapshot of a document containing a study protocol as it exists at a particular point in time. EXAMPLE(S): Version 3 of a breast cancer protocol. OTHER NAME(S): Amendment. NOTE(S): A version of the study protocol represents the characteristics and plan of the study which can be distilled into or abstracted from a version of the study protocol document. A StudyProtocolDocumentVersion is related to other supporting document versions involved in the study, including (but not limited to) informed consent documents, case report forms (CRFs), regulatory and approval documentation, correlative studies, etc. via the inherited association to DocumentVersionRelationship. A complete reference to a website (including http://) from which the document contents can be retrieved. EXAMPLE(S): In a Regulatory Product Submission (RPS) message, this identifies the file (with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)), which is part of the documentation. A URI is a compact string of characters used to identify or name a resource. The main purpose of this identification is to enable interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. URIs are defined in schemes defining a specific syntax and associated protocols.","longName":"3175110v1.0:2803208v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3175110","version":"1","preferredName":"Study Protocol Document Version Uniform Resource Locator","preferredDefinition":"The formal plan of an experiment or research activity, including the objective, rationale, design, materials and methods for the conduct of the study; intervention description, and method of data analysis.:An organized collection of records that describe a particular body of work.:A form or variant of a type or original; one of a sequence of copies of a program, each incorporating new modifications._A Uniform Resource Locator is an Internet address which tells a browser where to find an Internet resource.
