One ampere represents 6.24 x 10E18 unit electric charge carriers, such as electrons, passing a specified fixed point in one second.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"73E6891A-82AC-2251-E053-F662850A751F","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2018-08-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"HARTLEYG","dateCreated":"2018-08-20","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-08-20","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"D56636C2-5BF6-273F-E053-4EBD850ADDCD","beginDate":"2018-08-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2022-01-12","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2022-01-12","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"msec","valueDescription":"Millisecond","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"6406336","version":"1","preferredName":"Millisecond","longName":"6406336","preferredDefinition":"A unit of time equal to one thousandth of a second (10E-3 second).","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Millisecond","conceptCode":"C41140","definition":"A unit of time equal to one thousandth of a second (10E-3 second).","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"73E6891A-82D1-2251-E053-F662850A751F","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2018-08-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"HARTLEYG","dateCreated":"2018-08-20","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-08-20","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"D56636C2-5C00-273F-E053-4EBD850ADDCD","beginDate":"2018-08-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2022-01-12","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2022-01-12","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"PACKAGE","valueDescription":"Package Dosing Unit","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"6401788","version":"1","preferredName":"Package Dosing Unit","longName":"6401788","preferredDefinition":"A dosing unit equal to the amount of active ingredient(s) contained in a package.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Package Dosing Unit","conceptCode":"C48520","definition":"A dosing unit equal to the amount of active ingredient(s) contained in a package.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"7393A52F-4031-6FC4-E053-F662850A280A","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2018-08-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"TAYLORT","dateCreated":"2018-08-16","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-08-16","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"D56636C2-5C0A-273F-E053-4EBD850ADDCD","beginDate":"2018-08-20","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2022-01-12","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2022-01-12","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"oz","valueDescription":"Ounce","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2569429","version":"1","preferredName":"Ounce","longName":"2569429","preferredDefinition":"The traditional unit of mass.
