It can be found in large concentrations within the liver, spinal cord, and brain. Cholesterol is an important component of the membranes of cells, providing stability. It is the major precursor for the synthesis of vitamin D, of the various steroid hormones, including cortisol, cortisone, and aldosterone in the adrenal glands, and of the sex hormones progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone.  Cholesterol also has an important role for the brain synapses as well as in the immune system.  In conditions featuring elevated low density lipoproteins (LDL), cholesterol often forms plaque deposits in the walls of arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"7F9BB5BF-3909-A092-E040-BB89AD43198F","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-02-14","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2010-02-14","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-02-14","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"3009032","version":"1","preferredName":"Adjustment Baseline","preferredDefinition":"The act of making necessary corrections or modifications.:Baseline; an imaginary standard by which things are measured or compared.","longName":"C49157:C25213","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Adjustment","conceptCode":"C49157","definition":"The act of making necessary corrections or modifications.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Baseline","conceptCode":"C25213","definition":"A starting point to which things may be compared.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"7F43C641-B1A3-98A3-E040-BB89AD430B30","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-02-10","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2010-02-10","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-02-10","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008551","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessments","preferredDefinition":"evaluations of the patient and the patient's disease.","longName":"ASSESS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B22DA727-6718-5A2D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"eMERGE:Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"7FA44727-8BB9-5F5F-E040-BB89AD437160","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-02-15","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2010-02-15","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":"4/19/10 released eMERGE DECs per email approval from Jyoti today.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2655757","version":"1","preferredName":"Laboratory Result Value in mg/dL","preferredDefinition":"A laboratory result using the metric measure of milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).","longName":"2655757v1.0","context":"NHLBI","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"NUMBER","unitOfMeasure":"mg/dL","minLength":null,"maxLength":"6","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":"1","PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008556","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessment Results","preferredDefinition":"the results of evaluations of the patient and the patient's disease.","longName":"ASSESS_RESULTS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B2D08DE9-38BB-7208-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2655756","version":"1","preferredName":"Laboratory Result Milligram Value","preferredDefinition":"Laboratory; a workplace for the conduct of scientific research.:Outcome; a phenomenon that follows and is caused by some previous phenomenon.:A measure of weight.
