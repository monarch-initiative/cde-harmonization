Ligand binding increases phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. A potential heterodimer with ERBB3 and ERBB4 receptors, p185ERBB2 is an essential component of the heregulin/neuregulin receptor complex. ERBB2 homodimers do not bind heregulin but ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers do. Neuregulins do not interact with ERBB2 alone. The IL6 cytokine induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ERBB2 and ERBB3, but not EGFR. ERBB2 forms an IL6-dependent complex with the IL6R gp130 subunit resulting in MAPK activation. Expressed in fetal kidney and liver, herstatin is a 68 kD secreted product of an alternative ERBB2 transcript that retains intron 8. Herstatin binds p185ERBB2 as an inhibitor by disrupting ERBB2 dimers and reducing p185 tyrosine phosphorylation.  (from SWISS-PROT, OMIM and NCI):The designation for each member of the seventeenth largest human autosomal chromosome pair. Chromosome 17 spans more than 81 million base pairs and represents between 2.5 and 3% of the total DNA in normal diploid cells.:General term for a piece of DNA or RNA corresponding to a gene or sequence of interest, that has been labelled either radioactively or with some other detectable molecule, such as biotin, digoxygenin or fluorescein. As stretches of DNA or RNA with complementary sequences will (hybridize), a probe will label viral plaques, bacterial colonies or bands on a gel that contain the gene of interest. (On-line Medical Dictionary):A type of IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION in which target sequences are stained with fluorescent dye so their location and size can be determined using fluorescence microscopy. This staining is sufficiently distinct that the hybridization signal can be seen both in metaphase spreads and in interphase nuclei.:Performed; carried out.","longName":"3155923v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"ERBB2 Gene","conceptCode":"C17756","definition":"This gene plays a role in cellular proliferation and is involved in the oncogenic process through amplification and/or overexpression in several cancers.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"4"},{"longName":"Human Chromosome 17","conceptCode":"C13212","definition":"The designation for each member of the seventeenth largest human autosomal chromosome pair.
