In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F7C5DB4E-AC57-18B5-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-05-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"3133980","version":"1","preferredName":"Peak Standardized Uptake Value","preferredDefinition":"The most extreme possible amount or value; the highest point.:An effectively dimensionless measure of regional tracer uptake calculated as the activity concentration within a 2D region of interest (ROI) or 3D volume of interest (VOI) measured on a PET image (nCi1mL) 1[injected dose (nCi) 1 body weight (g)].","longName":"C48054:C69310","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Peak","conceptCode":"C48054","definition":"The most extreme possible amount or value; the highest point.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Standardized Uptake Value","conceptCode":"C69310","definition":"An effectively dimensionless measure of regional tracer uptake calculated as the activity concentration within a 2D region of interest (ROI) or 3D volume of interest (VOI) measured on a PET image (nCi1mL) / [injected dose (nCi) / body weight (g)].","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"8F01B57C-D389-0DBC-E040-BB89AD4368E6","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-08-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2010-08-29","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-08-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2233241","version":"1","preferredName":"Medical Imaging","preferredDefinition":"Events, people, materials and activities uniquely defined by medical imaging.
