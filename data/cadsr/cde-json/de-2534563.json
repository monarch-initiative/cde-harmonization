The system provides a reproducible description of the glandular architecture of prostate tissue to which a pathologist assigns a score depending primarily on the microscopic patterns of cancerous glands and cell morphology. The system correlates well with behavior at the extremes: Gleason 1+1 tumors are the most well differentiated, slowly growing and rarely spread; Gleason 4+5 tumors are the most poorly differentiated, often widely metastatic at the time of diagnosis. In the commoner intermediate grade tumors, however, behavior is extremely variable.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"21204675-4D04-4715-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-10-31","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CAE","dateCreated":"2006-10-31","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2431266","version":"1","preferredName":"Tertiary Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer","preferredDefinition":"definition pending","longName":"C48605","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Tertiary Gleason Pattern","conceptCode":"C48605","definition":"Prostate carcinoma patterns occupying less than 5% of the tumor.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"05DCEA00-2431-36A2-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-11-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CAP","dateCreated":"2005-11-18","modifiedBy":"SBREXT","dateModified":"2007-11-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2222502","version":"1","preferredName":"UML DEFAULT CD","preferredDefinition":"Default Conceptual Domain for UML Loader","longName":"UML DEFAULT CD","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F5E53F3B-47A4-52D1-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-04-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2005-04-29","modifiedBy":"DWARZEL","dateModified":"2021-04-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"212058E1-7FD5-53D9-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-10-31","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CAE","dateCreated":"2006-10-31","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":"Permission to Release DEC granted by primary curator in 8/2008","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2178537","version":"1","preferredName":"java.lang.Integer","preferredDefinition":"Generic value domain for a primitive java dataype that is an Integer (32-bit two's complement).","longName":"java.lang.Integer","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"java.lang.Integer","minLength":null,"maxLength":null,"minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2178532","version":"1","preferredName":"Bioinformatics","preferredDefinition":".","longName":"BIOINFORMATICS","context":"caCORE","contextVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RETIRED ARCHIVED","registrationStatus":"Retired","id":"CD81DD3C-8FFA-28BA-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-12-02","endDate":"2020-10-14","createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-12-02","modifiedBy":"TAYLORT","dateModified":"2020-10-14","changeDescription":"10.14.20 TL changed WFS from DRAFT NEW to RETIRED ARCHIVED and added an End Date in preparation of OneData.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2233101","version":"1","preferredName":"Number","preferredDefinition":"Number;
