The SI is maintained by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM, for Bureau International des Poids et Mesures), and is updated every few years by an international conference, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM, for Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures). SI has a short list of base units defined in an absolute way without referring to any other units: the metre, the kilogram, the second, the ampere, the kelvin, the mole, and the candela. The base units are consistent with the part of the metric system called the MKS system.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Mass","conceptCode":"C43246","definition":"The amount of matter in an object.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Code","conceptCode":"C25162","definition":"A symbol or combination of symbols which is assigned to the members of a collection.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"172703FB-8E73-058E-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-06-26","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2006-06-26","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-06-26","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"0DF2D8DA-7B09-4D14-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-03-01","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2006-03-01","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2008-12-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ClassificationSchemes":[],"AlternateNames":[{"name":"CCR","type":"USED_BY","context":"CCR"}],"ReferenceDocuments":[{"name":"UCUM Mass SI Codes","type":"Preferred Question Text","description":"UCUM Mass SI Codes","url":null,"context":"NCIP"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Qualified","id":"0DF2D8DA-7B29-4D14-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-03-01","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2006-03-01","modifiedBy":"REEVESD","dateModified":"2012-10-09","changeDescription":"Removed from data standard classification scheme.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
