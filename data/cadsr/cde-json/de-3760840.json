(3) Diagnostic studies seek better tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition. (4) Screening studies seek best way to detect diseases, health conditions. (5) Quality of Life (or Supportive Care) studies explore ways to improve comfort, quality of life for individuals with chronic illness.
