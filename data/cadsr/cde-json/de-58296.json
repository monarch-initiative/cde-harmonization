Located predominantly on B cells and macrophages, HLA-DR antigens function in antigen presentation to regulatory T cells in the immune response and in self/nonself discrimination. Invariant alpha and polymorphic beta chains have glycosylated N-termini, hydrophobic membrane regions, and hydrophilic C-termini. The heterodimer consists of 4 extracellular domains; invariant alpha-1, polymorphic N-terminal beta-1, and conserved Ig-like alpha-2 and beta-2. Alpha-1 and alpha-2 contain disulfide loops.
