Inhibition of the bcr-abl TK results in decreased proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in malignant cells of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) hematological malignancies such as CML and ALL; effects on c-kit TK activity inhibit mast-cell and cellular proliferation in those diseases overexpressing c-kit, such as mastocytosis and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Treatment Regimen","conceptCode":"C15697","definition":"A treatment plan that specifies the dosage, the schedule, and the duration of treatment.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"C7EF39C5-7643-45DB-E040-BB89AD435B6E","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2012-08-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-08-23","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"C7EF39C5-765C-45DB-E040-BB89AD435B6E","beginDate":"2012-08-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-08-23","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2012-08-23","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Temodar/Dasatinib","valueDescription":"Temozolomide Dasatinib Treatment Regimen","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3564428","version":"1","preferredName":"Temozolomide Dasatinib Treatment Regimen","longName":"3564428","preferredDefinition":"A triazene analog of dacarbazine with antineoplastic activity.

Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic.
