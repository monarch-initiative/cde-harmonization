NOTE(S): This type of study is used to register all types of non-protocol access to experimental treatments, including protocol exception, single-patient IND, treatment IND, compassionate use, emergency use, continued access and parallel track. A coded value specifying a trial pattern developed to compare treatment groups in a clinical pre-clinical trial. EXAMPLE(S): Parallel Group Design, Crossover Design, Factorial Designs, Cohort, Case-control, Case-only, Case-crossover, Ecologic or Community Studies, Family-based. NOTE(S): The configuration usually requires randomization to one or more treatment arms, each arm being allocated a different (or no) treatment.","longName":"3175185v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3175185","version":"1","preferredName":"Access Extension Study Protocol Version Design Pattern Code","preferredDefinition":"The right to obtain or make use of or take advantage of something (as services or membership); the right to enter.
