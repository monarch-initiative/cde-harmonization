The activity of administering the study drug is assessed to have caused the AE. A coded value specifying the degree of authoritativeness or certiitude of the date of the activity. EXAMPLE(S): date estimated, date greater than 100 days - day is correct, date known, date less than 100 days - date is correct, date previously reported NOTE(S): The concept of \"date unknown\" is captured by a null flavor of \"UNK\" on the date range attribute, rather than a code in this attribute.","longName":"3760467v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760467","version":"1","preferredName":"Causality Assessment Observation
