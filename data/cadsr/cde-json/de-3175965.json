{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3175965","version":"1","preferredName":"Plan Study Activity Blinded Description ISO21090.ST.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"The textual representation of the planned activity from the point of view of a blinded participant (study subject or study investigator). EXAMPLE(S): During the second treatment epoch of a study, Arms A and B are still blinded and Arm C is no longer blinded. So, Arm A and B must have identical blindedDescriptions. In a study with 3 arms, Arm 1 - standard vaccine given in three shots at 2 months, 5 months, and 12 months of age; Arm 2 - new vaccine given in three shots at 2 months, 5 months, and 12 months of age; Arm 3 - new vaccine given in two shots at 2 months and 5 months of age. Subjects assigned to the third arm are unblinded at some point during 5 months and 12 months. By the time of the Third Shot Epoch, the \"Arm 3/Third Shot\" activity can be called by this, its unblinded name. However, the \"Arm 1/Third Shot\" and \"Arm2/Third Shot\" activities still need blinded names. Both these activities would have the blinded name \"3-shot Arm/Third Shot\".","longName":"3174850v1.0:2803207v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3174850","version":"1","preferredName":"Plan Study Activity Blinded Description","preferredDefinition":"To devise, contrive, or formed in design.:A detailed examination, analysis, or critical inspection of a subject designed to discover facts about it.:An action taken in pursuit of an objective;
