The role of the hypothalamus in awareness of pleasure and pain is well established in the laboratory. It is involved in the expression of emotions, such as fear and rage, and in sexual behaviors. Despite its numerous vital functions, the hypothalamus in humans accounts for only 1/300 of total brain weight, and is about the size of an almond. Structurally, it is joined to the thalamus; the two work together to monitor the sleep-wake cycle.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-CEE2-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-05-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-05-28","modifiedBy":"COOPERM","dateModified":"2011-08-02","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"BEBE78F0-7279-6E45-E034-0003BA12F5E7","beginDate":"2003-05-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-05-28","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2005-03-29","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Cavernous sinus","valueDescription":"Cavernous sinus","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2566004","version":"1","preferredName":"Cavernous sinus","longName":"2566004","preferredDefinition":"Cavernous sinus","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Cavernous Sinus","conceptCode":"C12690","definition":"One of a pair of dural venous sinuses located on either side of the pituitary fossa and lateral to the sella turcica.
