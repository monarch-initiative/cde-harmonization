Upon administration, nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This results in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"18D28FE9-699E-68CC-E050-BB89AD437B6D","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2015-06-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"NELSONA","dateCreated":"2015-06-18","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2015-06-18","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2233610","version":"1","preferredName":"Administered","preferredDefinition":"Given.","longName":"C25382","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Administered","conceptCode":"C25382","definition":"The act of having given something (e.g., a medication or test).","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F95D94B9-D864-2792-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-06-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-06-13","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-06-13","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008538","version":"1","preferredName":"Therapies","preferredDefinition":"actions or administration of therapeutic agents to produce an effect that is intended to alter the course of a pathologic process (NCI).","longName":"TX","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B214D04D-9F05-1CA5-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-18","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"18D28FE9-69AC-68CC-E050-BB89AD437B6D","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2015-06-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"NELSONA","dateCreated":"2015-06-18","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":"released as part of draft content review -
