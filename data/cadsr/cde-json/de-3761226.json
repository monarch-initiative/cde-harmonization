{"DataElement":{"publicId":"3761226","version":"1","preferredName":"Study Protocol Document Version Number Text ISO21090.ST.SIMPLE.v1.0","preferredDefinition":"A representation of a particular edition or snapshot of a document containing a study protocol as it exists at a particular point in time. EXAMPLE(S): Version 3 of a breast cancer protocol. OTHER NAME(S): Amendment NOTE(S): Term \"protocol\" is somewhat overloaded, must be qualified to provide semantic context, so \"study protocol\" chosen to disambiguate from other protocols. Notion includes (not limited to) design, statistical considerations, activities to test particular hypothesis/answer particular question that is basis of study, characteristics, specifications, objective(s), background, pre-study/study/post-study portions of plan (including design, methodology, statistical considerations, organization). Study protocol related to other supporting documents, including (not limited to) informed consent documents, case report forms, regulatory/approval documentation, correlative studies, etc. (via inherited association to DocumentVersionRelationship). Complete notion of study protocol represented by StudyProtocol, StudyProtocolVersion, StudyProtocolDocument, StudyProtocolDocumentVersion, StudyExecution and their associations. Term \"Amendment\" needs to be disambiguated since sometimes refers to amended version of protocol (StudyProtocolDocumentVersion), other times to summary of changes (AmendmentChangeSummaryVersion). A character string that identifies a given collection of content of a document at a point in time. EXAMPLE(S): Could be an integer starting at 1, incrementing by 1, with version number incremented by 1 when a version is replaced, but can also be incremented more often to meet local requirements. NOTE(S): Different versions of same document belong to same document group. Over time, there may be multiple changes to document; allows capture of relationships between changes in instances of document over time; can be new version every time content changes.","longName":"3760433v1.0:3165771v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760433","version":"1","preferredName":"Study Protocol Document Version Number Text","preferredDefinition":"The formal plan of an experiment or research activity, including the objective, rationale, design, materials and methods for the conduct of the study;
