Most cases are seen in patients over the age of 50 years, but this tumor can also occur in younger individuals and even in children. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in males than females and is associated with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.

Grossly, hepatocellular carcinoma may present as a single mass, as multiple nodules, or as diffuse liver involvement.
