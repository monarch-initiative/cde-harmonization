The result of the process may be similar or different kind of material, e.g. specimen may be result of specimen processing step (aliquot or division of a specimen), or alternatively blood product has anticoagulants added to it to preserve product. Other processing steps, e.g. adding growth factor to induce cell growth, may be performed on blood product.

EXAMPLE(S): Day 1, Days 10-20 OTHER NAME(S): Study Day NOTE(S): The study-defined reference activity can be different from study to study. The study day for a date after this reference activity is a positive integer calculated as the difference in the two dates + 1.
