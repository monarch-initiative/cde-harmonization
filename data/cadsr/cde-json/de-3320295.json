CD3D, CD3G and CD3E are transmembrane proteins with one extracellular immunoglobulin domain and one intracellular ITAM domain. The CD3 complex is a T-cell co-receptor that noncovalently associates with either the disulfide bound heterodimeric alpha/beta T-cell receptor (TCR) or gamma/delta TCR and two copies of the accessory protein, T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 zeta chain (CD247), which is a transmembrane protein with three ITAM domains. The TCR moiety of the TCR-CD3 complex binds to MHC and processed antigens on antigen presenting cells, which triggers phosphorylation of and cellular propagation of the signal by CD247 and the CD3 complex.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Slide","conceptCode":"C25325","definition":"A flat rectangular piece of glass on which specimens can be mounted for microscopic study.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B3218C99-9D73-A0E6-E040-BB89AD435573","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-12-02","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2011-12-02","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2011-12-02","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2442984","version":"1","preferredName":"Submission","preferredDefinition":"Submission; a message submitted for the judgment of others.","longName":"C25694","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Submission","conceptCode":"C25694","definition":"Something submitted for the judgment or consideration of others.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"0A2C1D25-8883-603A-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-01-12","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2006-01-12","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-01-12","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008547","version":"1","preferredName":"Specimen Characteristics","preferredDefinition":"attributes of a patient's laboratory sample, including the source, condition, and fixative.","longName":"SPEC_CHAR","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B22908C4-638F-4A74-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B3218C99-9D81-A0E6-E040-BB89AD435573","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-12-02","endDate":null,"createdBy":"COOPERM","dateCreated":"2011-12-02","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":"Released per approval by B.McClure-Shimel. mc 12/14/11","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2181608","version":"1","preferredName":"Yes No Character Indicator","preferredDefinition":"Indicator of Yes or No to a question.","longName":"Y_N_CHAR_IND","context":"CCR","contextVersion":"1","type":"Enumerated","dataType":"CHARACTER","minLength":"2","maxLength":"3","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[{"value":"No","valueDescription":"No ","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"2567170","version":"1","preferredName":"No","longName":"2567170","preferredDefinition":"The non-affirmative response to a question.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"No","conceptCode":"C49487","definition":"The non-affirmative response to a question.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"2509CE87-D36F-5C23-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-11-13","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SBREXT","dateCreated":"2003-11-13","modifiedBy":"SOKKERL","dateModified":"2023-12-05","changeDescription":"Updated to add NCIt concept relationship.
