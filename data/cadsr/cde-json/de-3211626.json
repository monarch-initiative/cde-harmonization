Until recently, surgery has been the only effective therapy for this tumor.  However, many patients still experience recurrence.  Conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been of limited value.  A KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (also known as STI-571 or Gleevec), is now effective in the treatment of relapsed and unresectable cases.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"9890B54F-84AF-2C65-E040-BB89AD4320B1","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-12-29","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2010-12-29","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-12-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"9F52E161-CCC2-C614-E040-BB89AD4377D5","beginDate":null,"endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CBM","dateCreated":"2011-03-25","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2011-03-25","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Gastroschisis","valueDescription":"Gastroschisis","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3211093","version":"1","preferredName":"Gastroschisis","longName":"3211093","preferredDefinition":"A congenital birth defect characterized by the exposure of the fetal intestines outside the abdominal wall through an abdominal wall opening.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Gastroschisis","conceptCode":"C84725","definition":"A congenital birth defect characterized by the exposure of the fetal intestines outside the abdominal wall through an abdominal wall opening.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"9F52E161-CCCE-C614-E040-BB89AD4377D5","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-03-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CBM","dateCreated":"2011-03-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"9F52E161-CCE4-C614-E040-BB89AD4377D5","beginDate":null,"endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CBM","dateCreated":"2011-03-25","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2011-03-25","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Genu Varum","valueDescription":"Genu Varum","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3211094","version":"1","preferredName":"Genu Varum","longName":"3211094","preferredDefinition":"A deformity of the legs characterized by medial angulation, resulting in a bow appearance.","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Genu Varum","conceptCode":"C84726","definition":"A deformity of the legs characterized by medial angulation, resulting in a bow appearance.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"9F52E161-CCFA-C614-E040-BB89AD4377D5","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2011-03-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CBM","dateCreated":"2011-03-25","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"9F52E161-CD10-C614-E040-BB89AD4377D5","beginDate":null,"endDate":null,"createdBy":"UMLLOADER_CBM","dateCreated":"2011-03-25","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2011-03-25","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease","valueDescription":"Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3211095","version":"1","preferredName":"Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease","longName":"3211095","preferredDefinition":"A very rare and fatal disorder of spongiform encephalopathy usually caused by mutations of the prion protein (PRNP) gene.
