The gene as a functional unit consists of a discrete segment of a giant DNA molecule containing the purine (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidine (cytosine and thymine) bases in the ordered and correct sequence that encodes a specific functional product (i.e., a protein or RNA molecule). Protein synthesis is mediated by molecules of messenger-RNA formed on the chromosome with the gene acting as template. The RNA then passes into the cytoplasm and becomes oriented on the ribosomes where it in turn acts as template to organize a chain of amino acids to form a peptide. Genes normally occur in pairs in all cells except gametes, as a consequence of the fact that all chromosomes are paired except the sex chromosomes (X and Y) of the male._LocusLink is a web application from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
