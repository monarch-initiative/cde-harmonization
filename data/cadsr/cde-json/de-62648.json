The clinical stages of TB are primary or initial infection, latent or dormant infection, and recrudescent or adult-type TB. Ninety to 95% of primary TB infections may go unrecognized. Histopathologically, tissue lesions consist of granulomas which usually undergo central caseation necrosis. Local symptoms of TB vary according to the part affected; acute symptoms include hectic fever, sweats, and emaciation; serious complications include granulomatous erosion of pulmonary bronchi associated with hemoptysis. If untreated, progressive TB may be associated with a high degree of mortality. This infection is frequently observed in immunocompromised individuals with AIDS or a history of illicit IV drug use.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Skin Test","conceptCode":"C17137","definition":"A preparation of an antigenic component of an infectious agent that is administered to a patient in order to determine whether previous exposure to the agent has occurred, and/or to assess the integrity of the patient's cellular immune system.
