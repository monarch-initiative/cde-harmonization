EXAMPLE(S): (1) randomization, direct assignment based on eligibility criteria, etc. (2) \"Escalating dose cohort studies\" enroll subjects in successive arms, i.e., one arm is completely filled before any subjects are enrolled in the next arm. In such a study, allocation depends on which arms have been fully enrolled and which are currently open for enrollment. Note that this example assumes that the experimental unit is the subject (rather than a part of a subject or a group of subjects). A coded value specifying the motivation, cause, or rationale of an activity. EXAMPLE(S): routine requirement, drug reaction, infectious disease reporting requirement, on patient request.","longName":"3760419v1.0:2803321v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3760419","version":"1","preferredName":"Investigational Entity Allocation
