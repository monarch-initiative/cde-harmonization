Assembled with BCR, CD19 decreases the threshold for antigen receptor-dependent stimulation of B lymphocyte proliferation and intersects with many intracellular signaling pathways. CD19 functions as an adaptor protein for Src family kinase amplification, crucial for antigen receptor-induced signal transduction. Following BCR/CD19 ligation, LYN (Src kinase) phosphorylates CD19-Y513, binds to the CD19-SH2 domain and phosphorylates CD19-Y482. CD19-pY482 recruits more LYN, leading to LYN phosphorylation and CD19-Y391 phosphorylation. CD19-pY391 recruits VAV, phosphorylated by LYN.
