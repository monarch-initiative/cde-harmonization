Scans often used in diagnosing, staging, and monitoring disease include liver scans, bone scans, and computed tomography (CT) or computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. In liver scanning and bone scanning, radioactive substances that are injected into the bloodstream collect in these organs. A scanner that detects the radiation is used to create pictures. In CT scanning, an x-ray machine linked to a computer is used to produce detailed pictures of organs inside the body. MRI scans use a large magnet connected to a computer to create pictures of areas inside the body.","longName":"C12674:C17999","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Axilla","conceptCode":"C12674","definition":"The underside concavity where the arm and the shoulder are joined.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Scan","conceptCode":"C17999","definition":"The data or image obtained by gathering information with a sensing device.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"36A5DC03-3120-42B3-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2007-08-01","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CHILLIJ","dateCreated":"2007-08-01","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2007-08-01","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2233241","version":"1","preferredName":"Medical Imaging","preferredDefinition":"Events, people, materials and activities uniquely defined by medical imaging.
