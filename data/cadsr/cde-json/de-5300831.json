The mutation of these genes is associated with the formation of familial breast and ovarian cancer.:BRCA2 putatively functions as a tumor suppressor gene, however, its exact function has not been well characterized. The similarity of, and functional analysis of, BRCA2 and BRCA1 proteins, suggests that these proteins function in the same genetic pathway. BRCA1 and BRCA2 have transcriptional activation potential and the two proteins are associated with the activation of double-strand break repair and/or homologous recombination. The two proteins have been shown to coexist and colocalize in a biochemical complex. (from LocusLink):A functional unit of heredity which occupies a specific position (locus) on a particular chromosome, is capable of reproducing itself exactly at each cell division, and directs the formation of an enzyme or other protein. The gene as a functional unit consists of a discrete segment of a giant DNA molecule containing the purine (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidine (cytosine and thymine) bases in the ordered and correct sequence that encodes a specific functional product (i.e., a protein or RNA molecule).","longName":"C17965:C18120:C16612","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"BRCA1 Gene","conceptCode":"C17965","definition":"This gene plays a role in cell cycle control, regulation of transcription and the maintenance of genomic stability.
