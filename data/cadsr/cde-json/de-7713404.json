In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Uptake","conceptCode":"C71688","definition":"The absorption by a tissue of some substance, food material, mineral, etc., and its permanent or temporary retention.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Scale","conceptCode":"C25664","definition":"An ordered reference standard used to measure incremental changes.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"C5865E2A-9FA9-2D3A-E053-4EBD850A0553","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2021-06-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CARPIOJ","dateCreated":"2021-06-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2021-06-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"COG CRF:Children's Oncology Group Case Report Form","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"C5865E2A-9FBA-2D3A-E053-4EBD850A0553","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2021-06-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CARPIOJ","dateCreated":"2021-06-24","modifiedBy":"CARPIOJ","dateModified":"2021-06-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ClassificationSchemes":[],"AlternateNames":[],"ReferenceDocuments":[{"name":"What is the lesion FDG PET up","type":"Preferred Question Text","description":"What is the lesion FDG PET uptake?","url":null,"context":"COG"},{"name":"COG CRF Text 1","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"Lesion FDG PET Uptake","url":null,"context":"COG"}],"origin":"COG CRF:Children's Oncology Group Case Report Form","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"C5865E2A-A126-2D3A-E053-4EBD850A0553","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2021-06-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CARPIOJ","dateCreated":"2021-06-24","modifiedBy":"CARPIOJ","dateModified":"2021-06-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
