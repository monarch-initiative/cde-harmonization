In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Medical Imaging","conceptCode":"C16831","definition":"In medicine, any technology which helps in visualization of any biological process, cell, tissue or organ for the screening, diagnosis, surgical procedure or therapy.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F7C5DB4E-ACCD-18B5-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-24","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-05-24","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-24","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2230962","version":"1","preferredName":"Inadequate Assessment","preferredDefinition":"No value exists.:Examination of the body by auscultation, palpation, percussion, inspection, and olfaction.
