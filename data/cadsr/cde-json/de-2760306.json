CD3D, CD3G and CD3E are transmembrane proteins with one extracellular immunoglobulin domain and one intracellular ITAM domain. The CD3 complex is a T-cell co-receptor that noncovalently associates with either the disulfide bound heterodimeric alpha/beta T-cell receptor (TCR) or gamma/delta TCR and two copies of the accessory protein, T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 zeta chain (CD247), which is a transmembrane protein with three ITAM domains. The TCR moiety of the TCR-CD3 complex binds to MHC and processed antigens on antigen presenting cells, which triggers phosphorylation of and cellular propagation of the signal by CD247 and the CD3 complex.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Present","conceptCode":"C25626","definition":"Being or existing in a specified place or at the specified time.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Cell","conceptCode":"C12508","definition":"The smallest units of living structure capable of independent existence, composed of a membrane-enclosed mass of protoplasm and containing a nucleus or nucleoid.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"4FF772F2-494C-3334-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-06-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZHANGW","dateCreated":"2008-06-18","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-06-18","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2486250","version":"1","preferredName":"Test","preferredDefinition":"A procedure for critical evaluation;
