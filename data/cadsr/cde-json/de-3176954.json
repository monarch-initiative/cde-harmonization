NOTE(S): A randomization book is a predefined set of assignments to portions of a study based on criteria, such as stratum group for example, that ensures a desired distribution of subjects across those portions of the study. For example, the book entries indicate which arm a given subject, Joe, is assigned to based on the fact that he's the 5th person in stratum group #2. A coded value specifying the number of occurrences of a planned activity within a given time period. EXAMPLE(S): BID = Two times per day, at unspecified times (does not necessarily imply that these are 12 hours apart); Q12H = Every twelve hours.","longName":"3175451v1.0:2803170v1.0","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","DataElementConcept":{"publicId":"3175451","version":"1","preferredName":"Book Randomization Allocation Plan Study Activity Repeat Frequency Code","preferredDefinition":"A volume made up of pages fastened along one edge and enclosed between protective covers.
