It is considered as a disease of Western-world lifestyle. Grossly, most colorectal carcinomas are either polypoid or of the ulcerative-infiltrating type. Adenocarcinoma is the most common carcinoma in the colon and rectum. Colorectal adenocarcinoma can be divided in three grades: Grade I (low grade or well-differentiated), grade II (average grade or moderately differentiated) and grade III (poorly differentiated). The following histopathologic features have been shown to be prognostic indicators in multivariate analysis: microacinar versus macroacinar growth pattern, endocrine cells detected by chromogranin immunohistochemistry, Crohn's-like reaction and tumor budding. The standard therapy for colorectal carcinoma is surgical resection. The 5-year crude survival rate after curative resection for colorectal carcinomas ranges between 40% and 60% in most large series (Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology, 3rd ed., 1999).: Chronological record of health and disease events of family members and ancestors.
