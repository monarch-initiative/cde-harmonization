YYYY is a year of the Gregorian Calendar and may contain the integers 1 or 2 in the first position and the integers 0 to 9 in the remaining three positions. MM is a month; the months of the Gregorian Calendar should be represented by the values 00 to 12 beginning with January as 01. DD is a day and may be represented by the values 00 to 31. A Full Date would contain all three elements in the format YYYYMMDD. Partial Dates may be expressed by using the data elements for Year, Month, or Day.  The display format for Date information is determined by programmatic requirements.]","longName":"DT_VAL","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"DATE","minLength":"8","maxLength":"8","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008561","version":"1","preferredName":"Occurrences","preferredDefinition":"dates, times, and durations.","longName":"OCURS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B53BD1AB-090B-398B-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-01-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-01-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2414933","version":"1","preferredName":"Value","preferredDefinition":"A numerical quantity measured or assigned or computed.","longName":"C25712","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Value","conceptCode":"C25712","definition":"A numerical quantity measured or assigned or computed.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Standard","id":"02772734-9BE5-6ADF-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-10-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CAMPBELB","dateCreated":"2005-10-06","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-10-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"EACFDBFA-F4DF-25E6-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2004-12-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"CURTIST","dateCreated":"2004-12-09","modifiedBy":"CHILLIJ","dateModified":"2010-03-18","changeDescription":"3/18/2010 Add DICOM Date as alternate name and definition.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ClassificationSchemes":[{"publicId":"2008601","version":"1","longName":"C3D Domain","context":"CCR","ClassificationSchemeItems":[{"publicId":"2812367","version":"1","longName":"caBIG","context":"CCR"}]},{"publicId":"2182125","version":"1","longName":"CCR Implementation","context":"CCR","ClassificationSchemeItems":[{"publicId":"2811673","version":"1","longName":"C3D","context":"CCR"}]},{"publicId":"2183535","version":"1","longName":"Clinical Trial Mgmt Systems","context":"NCIP","ClassificationSchemeItems":[{"publicId":"2812625","version":"1","longName":"CTMS C3D Adopter Sites","context":"NCIP"},{"publicId":"2812726","version":"1","longName":"U Nebraska Med Center","context":"NCIP"},{"publicId":"2812870","version":"1","longName":"UNMC New CDEs","context":"NCIP"}]},{"publicId":"3896529","version":"1","longName":"Consortia 2012 Studies","context":"DCP","ClassificationSchemeItems":[{"publicId":"3694151","version":"1","longName":"MAY2012-00-01","context":"DCP"},{"publicId":"4528051","version":"1","longName":"MAY2013-02-02","context":"DCP"},{"publicId":"5612586","version":"1","longName":"MAY2016-07-01","context":"DCP"},{"publicId":"6005698","version":"1","longName":"MAY2017-09-01","context":"DCP"}]}],"AlternateNames":[{"name":"DCP","type":"USED_BY","context":"DCP"}],"ReferenceDocuments":[{"name":"Meal Date","type":"Preferred Question Text","description":"Meal Date","url":null,"context":"NCIP"},{"name":"DCP Text 1","type":"Alternate Question Text","description":"(Last) Meal date","url":null,"context":"DCP"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B7311C16-9150-787B-E040-BB89AD436FB1","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2012-01-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2012-01-23","modifiedBy":"TSESU","dateModified":"2018-01-11","changeDescription":"Curated for UNMC clinical trial","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
