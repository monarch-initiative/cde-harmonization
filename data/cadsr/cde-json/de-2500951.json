CHGA is also secreted by many endocrine neoplasms: pheochromocytoma, parathyroid adenoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, carcinoids, oat-cell lung cancer, pancreatic islet-cell tumors, and aortic-body tumor.  Its secretion is inversely proportional to extracellular calcium concentration, as is its degree of phosphorylation.  Its function is unknown.  Pancreastatin, derived from CHGA (pancreatic alpha cells), may be important for the homeostasis of blood insulin levels.  Chromostatin (pancreatic beta cells) is also a CHGA-derived bioactive peptide.  (from OMIM 118910 and NCI):A substance sometimes found in an increased amount in the blood, other body fluids, or tissues and which may mean that a certain type of cancer is in the body. Examples of tumor markers include CA 125 (ovarian cancer), CA 15-3 (breast cancer), CEA (ovarian, lung, breast, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract cancers), and PSA (prostate cancer).
