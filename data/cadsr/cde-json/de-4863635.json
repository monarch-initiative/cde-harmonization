In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"F7C5E8C3-16D7-19DD-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-05-25","endDate":null,"createdBy":"SHIDED","dateCreated":"2005-05-25","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-05-25","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"4863632","version":"1","preferredName":"Reduced Assessment","preferredDefinition":"Made less in size or amount or degree.:The final result of a determination of the value, significance, or extent of.","longName":"C25640:C25217","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Reduced","conceptCode":"C25640","definition":"Made less in size or amount or degree.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Assessment","conceptCode":"C25217","definition":"The final result of a determination of the value, significance, or extent of.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"18448ADC-2BE7-0A1C-E050-BB89AD431FED","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2015-06-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZIEGLERK","dateCreated":"2015-06-11","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2015-06-11","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008551","version":"1","preferredName":"Assessments","preferredDefinition":"evaluations of the patient and the patient's disease.","longName":"ASSESS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B22DA727-6718-5A2D-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"Alliance Case Report Form","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"18448ADC-2BF8-0A1C-E050-BB89AD431FED","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2015-06-11","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZIEGLERK","dateCreated":"2015-06-11","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2019325","version":"1","preferredName":"Percentage Value","preferredDefinition":"the numerical quantity measured or assigned or computed as a fraction or ratio with 100 understood as the denominator.","longName":"PCT_VAL","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"NUMBER","minLength":null,"maxLength":"4","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":"1","format":"%","PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008541","version":"1","preferredName":"Numbers","preferredDefinition":"the set of non-negative integers.","longName":"NUMS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B227CE66-2830-4A7B-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-19","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-19","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2208119","version":"1","preferredName":"Percentage Value","preferredDefinition":"Percentage;
