CD3D, CD3G and CD3E are transmembrane proteins with one extracellular immunoglobulin domain and one intracellular ITAM domain. The CD3 complex is a T-cell co-receptor that noncovalently associates with either the disulfide bound heterodimeric alpha/beta T-cell receptor (TCR) or gamma/delta TCR and two copies of the accessory protein, T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 zeta chain (CD247), which is a transmembrane protein with three ITAM domains. The TCR moiety of the TCR-CD3 complex binds to MHC and processed antigens on antigen presenting cells, which triggers phosphorylation of and cellular propagation of the signal by CD247 and the CD3 complex.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"Present","conceptCode":"C25626","definition":"Being or existing in a specified place or at the specified time.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Cell","conceptCode":"C12508","definition":"The smallest units of living structure capable of independent existence, composed of a membrane-enclosed mass of protoplasm and containing a nucleus or nucleoid.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"4FF772F2-494C-3334-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-06-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZHANGW","dateCreated":"2008-06-18","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2008-06-18","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"Property":{"publicId":"2486250","version":"1","preferredName":"Test","preferredDefinition":"A procedure for critical evaluation; a means of determining the presence, quality, or truth of something.","longName":"C25294","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Laboratory Procedure","conceptCode":"C25294","definition":"Any procedure that involves testing or manipulating a sample of blood, urine, or other body substance in a laboratory setting.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"15A9DA1A-D89C-6C6C-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-06-07","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MAESKEB","dateCreated":"2006-06-07","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-06-07","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008557","version":"1","preferredName":"Lab Results","preferredDefinition":"the results of laboratory tests.","longName":"LAB_RESULTS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B2CFBA7D-D009-7227-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":"NMDP:National Marrow Donor Program","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"4FF772F2-495A-3334-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2008-06-18","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZHANGW","dateCreated":"2008-06-18","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":".","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2794421","version":"1","preferredName":"Cell Total Integer::2 Decimal Place Count","preferredDefinition":"The smallest units of living structure capable of independent existence, composed of a membrane-enclosed mass of protoplasm and containing a nucleus or nucleoid._Pertaining to an entirety or whole, also constituting the full quantity or extent; complete; derived by addition._A number with no fractional part, including the negative and positive numbers as well as zero.::2_An indication of the specific number of digits to be expected to the right of the decimal point in a line of numbers._To determine the number or amount of something; the result of this activity.","longName":"CELL_TTL_2D_CT","context":"NHLBI","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"NUMBER","minLength":null,"maxLength":"100","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":"2","format":"9999.99","PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008557","version":"1","preferredName":"Lab Results","preferredDefinition":"the results of laboratory tests.","longName":"LAB_RESULTS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B2CFBA7D-D009-7227-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2794420","version":"1","preferredName":"Cell Total Integer::2 Decimal Place Count","preferredDefinition":"The smallest units of living structure capable of independent existence, composed of a membrane-enclosed mass of protoplasm and containing a nucleus or nucleoid.
