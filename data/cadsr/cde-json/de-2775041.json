Scans often used in diagnosing, staging, and monitoring disease include liver scans, bone scans, and computed tomography (CT) or computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

In CT scanning, an x-ray machine linked to a computer is used to produce detailed pictures of organs inside the body.
