Through direct attachment to the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus also meters secretions controlling water balance and milk production in the female. The role of the hypothalamus in awareness of pleasure and pain is well established in the laboratory. It is involved in the expression of emotions, such as fear and rage, and in sexual behaviors. Despite its numerous vital functions, the hypothalamus in humans accounts for only 1/300 of total brain weight, and is about the size of an almond. Structurally, it is joined to the thalamus; the two work together to monitor the sleep-wake cycle.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"2"},{"longName":"And/Or","conceptCode":"C48928","definition":"Used to indicate that either or both of two items or options may be valid.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"No","displayOrder":"1"},{"longName":"Suprasellar Region","conceptCode":"C42602","definition":"The area above or over the sella turcica.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"8E7FF1BF-394F-6CDF-E040-BB89AD437311","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2010-08-23","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZHANGW","dateCreated":"2010-08-23","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2010-08-23","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"07845A73-9C37-0BD1-E050-BB89AD4349AF","beginDate":"2010-07-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2014-11-10","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2014-11-10","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Other lymph nodes","valueDescription":"Other Lymph Node","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"3131318","version":"1","preferredName":"Other Lymph Node","longName":"3131318","preferredDefinition":"Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned.: A rounded mass of lymphatic tissue that is surrounded by a capsule of connective tissue.
