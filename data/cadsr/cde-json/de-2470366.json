Gleason in 1977. The system provides a reproducible description of the glandular architecture of prostate tissue to which a pathologist assigns a score depending primarily on the microscopic patterns of cancerous glands and cell morphology. The system correlates well with behavior at the extremes: Gleason 1+1 tumors are the most well differentiated, slowly growing and rarely spread; Gleason 4+5 tumors are the most poorly differentiated, often widely metastatic at the time of diagnosis. In the commoner intermediate grade tumors, however, behavior is extremely variable.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"10C711D2-73BA-7500-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-04-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PWEST","dateCreated":"2006-04-06","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2006-04-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008537","version":"1","preferredName":"Diagnosis","preferredDefinition":"the process of identifying a disease by the signs and symptoms (NCI Glossary).","longName":"DX","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B205508C-8324-69B0-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2002-12-17","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2002-12-17","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"10C711D2-73CB-7500-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-04-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PWEST","dateCreated":"2006-04-06","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2016-06-06","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ValueDomain":{"publicId":"2018550","version":"1","preferredName":"Date","preferredDefinition":"The date on which an observation was made or an event occurred.","longName":"DT","context":"NCI Standards","contextVersion":"1","type":"Non-enumerated","dataType":"DATE","minLength":null,"maxLength":"8","minValue":null,"maxValue":null,"decimalPlace":null,"format":"MM/DD/YYYY","PermissibleValues":[],"ConceptualDomain":{"publicId":"2008561","version":"1","preferredName":"Occurrences","preferredDefinition":"dates, times, and durations.","longName":"OCURS","context":"CTEP","contextVersion":"2.31","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"B53BD1AB-090B-398B-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-01-27","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-01-27","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2003-10-29","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"RepresentationTerm":{"publicId":"2233081","version":"1","preferredName":"Date","preferredDefinition":"a particular day specified as the time something has, or will, happen.","longName":"C25164","context":"NCIP","contextVersion":"1","Concepts":[{"longName":"Date","conceptCode":"C25164","definition":"The particular day, month and year an event has happened or will happen.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":"NCI Thesaurus","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Standard","id":"F90B5E56-BB15-0F45-E034-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2005-06-09","endDate":null,"createdBy":"REEVESD","dateCreated":"2005-06-09","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2005-06-09","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Standard","id":"B54EF112-5457-674A-E034-0003BA12F5E7","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2003-01-28","endDate":null,"createdBy":"MSUPLEY","dateCreated":"2003-01-28","modifiedBy":"ZHWENDY","dateModified":"2023-12-12","changeDescription":"8/3/17 tt added Diagnosis CSI. 6/20/17 jk transferred to NCI Standards per confirmation by Brian Campbell as part of Round 5 finalization task, added reg status.","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"ClassificationSchemes":[],"AlternateNames":[],"ReferenceDocuments":[{"name":"Date Baseline Surgical Gleaso","type":"Preferred Question Text","description":"Date Baseline Surgical Gleason Score Obtained","url":null,"context":"CTEP"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"10C7215F-ADCE-0295-E044-0003BA3F9857","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2006-04-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"PWEST","dateCreated":"2006-04-06","modifiedBy":"CAMPBELB","dateModified":"2011-11-08","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"}}
