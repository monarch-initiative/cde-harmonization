Designed to overcome imatinib resistance, nilotinib binds to and stabilizes the inactive conformation of the kinase domain of the Abl protein of the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, resulting in the inhibition of the Bcr-Abl-mediated proliferation of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. This agent also inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) and c-kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated and constitutively activated in most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). With a binding mode that is energetically more favorable than that of imatinib, nilotinib has been shown to have an approximately 20-fold increased potency in kinase and proliferation assays compared to imatinib.","evsSource":"NCI_CONCEPT_CODE","primaryIndicator":"Yes","displayOrder":"0"}],"origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"4EA044AC-B549-3351-E053-F662850A8B45","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2017-05-03","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2017-05-03","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2018-01-19","changeDescription":null,"administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},"origin":null,"id":"75AC7369-E786-1EBD-E053-F662850A1EEE","beginDate":"2018-09-12","endDate":null,"createdBy":"KUMMEROA","dateCreated":"2018-09-12","modifiedBy":"ONEDATA","dateModified":"2018-09-12","deletedIndicator":"No"},{"value":"Midostaurin","valueDescription":"Midostaurin","ValueMeaning":{"publicId":"5805895","version":"1","preferredName":"Midostaurin","longName":"5805895","preferredDefinition":"A synthetic indolocarbazole multikinase inhibitor with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities.
