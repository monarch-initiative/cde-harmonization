They catalyze the endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA sequences which lack the species-specific methylation pattern in the host cell's DNA. Cleavage yields random or specific double-stranded fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates. The function of restriction enzymes is to destroy any foreign DNA that invades the host cell. Most have been studied in bacterial systems, but a few have been found in eukaryotic organisms. They are also used as tools for the systematic dissection and mapping of chromosomes, in the determination of base sequences of DNAs, and have made it possible to splice and recombine genes from one organism into the genome of another.

The vertical relationships consist of \"isa\" statements that form a logical hierarchy (taxonomy or subsumption graph). In general, concepts above a given concept are referred to as superconcepts or parents and those below as subconcepts or children. In addition, there are horizontal named realationships between concepts called Roles, binary relations between concepts that provide a machine-interpretable definition of a concept and the means for discrimination of sibling concepts. A concept may also include Properties, named slots that allow attachment of external information to concepts.:In UML modeling, an association that is also a class.
