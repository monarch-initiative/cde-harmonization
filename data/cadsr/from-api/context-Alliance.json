This formulation solubilizes paclitaxel without the use of the solvent Cremophor, thereby permitting the administration of larger doses of paclitaxel while avoiding the toxic effects associated with Cremophor.treatment plan.","longName":"ADJNABPACLITAXEL","contextName":"Alliance","contextVersion":"1","dataElementConceptPublicId":"2195790","dataElementConceptVersion":"1","valueDomainPublicId":"2180457","valueDomainVersion":"2","origin":"NCCTG CRF:North Central Cancer Treatment Group Case Report Form","workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"E1A80601-1F0B-6B0B-E040-BB89AD4306D3","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2013-07-16","endDate":null,"createdBy":"ZIEGLERK","dateCreated":"2013-07-16","modifiedBy":"SBR","dateModified":"2013-10-25","changeNote":" Changed from CTEP to Alliance for by script Fri Oct 25 15:25:44 EDT 2013","administrativeNotes":null,"unresolvedIssues":null,"deletedIndicator":"No"},{"publicId":"3812556","version":"1","preferredName":"Adjuvant Therapy Doxorubicin Administered Yes No Indicator","preferredDefinition":"The yes/no indicator of information related to the administration of doxorubicin in an adjuvant setting.

This agent is also incorporated into DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine, which results in the disruption of DNA replication. In addition, mercaptopurine is converted to 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (MMPR) by 6-thiopurine methyltransferase; MMPRs are also potent inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis.
