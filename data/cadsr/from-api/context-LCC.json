Ramipril is converted in the liver by de-esterification into its active form ramiprilat, which inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This abolishes the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and leads to vasodilatation. This agent also causes an increase in bradykinin levels and a decrease in angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, thereby promoting diuresis and natriuresis.","longName":"3838282v1.0:3506068v1.0","contextName":"LCC","contextVersion":"1","dataElementConceptPublicId":"3734517","dataElementConceptVersion":"1","valueDomainPublicId":"3734519","valueDomainVersion":"1","origin":null,"workflowStatus":"RELEASED","registrationStatus":"Application","id":"E3512C02-7265-95B4-E040-BB89AD430159","latestVersionIndicator":"Yes","beginDate":"2013-08-06","endDate":null,"createdBy":"HARTLEYG","dateCreated":"2013-08-06","modifiedBy":"FORMBUILDER","dateModified":"2013-08-16","changeNote":"SAFE-HEaRT.
