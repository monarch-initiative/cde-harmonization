"scoring_530301","px530301_phenx_delayed_reward_discounting_monetary_choice_questionnaire",,"descriptive","Scoring

A participant's discounting curve may be calculated according to the following function:

V = A/(1+kD)

V is the present value of the delayed reward A at delay D, and k is the rate of discounting. k typically falls between 0.0 and 0.5, with smaller values indicating a lack of discounting and preference for delayed rewards and higher values indicating strong discounting and a preference for immediate rewards. Thus higher values of k are indicative of high levels of impulsivity.

There are two ways of scoring the Monetary-Choice Questionnaire. The first involves hand scoring to get an estimate of k following the guidelines given in Kirby (2000). The second involves fitting a logistic regression function to individual responses following procedures described in Wileyto et al. (2004).

Estimating Discounting Rate

The following lists the calculated k values (the degree of discounting) at indifference for each question (i.e., when the subjective value of the 
immediate and delayed rewards are equivalent).

Questions 13, 1 & 9:  k at indifference=.00016
Questions 20, 6 & 17:  k at indifference=.00040
Questions 26, 24 & 12:  k at indifference=.0010
Questions 22, 16 & 15:  k at indifference=.0025
Questions 3, 10 & 2:  k at indifference=.0060
Questions 18, 21 & 25:  k at indifference=.016
Questions 5, 14 & 23:  k at indifference=.041
Questions 7, 8 & 19:  k at indifference=.10
Questions 11, 27 & 4:  k at indifference=.25

An estimate of the respondent's discounting rate can be calculated as the geometric mean (to avoid underweighting) of the k at indifference between the two questions that reflect when the respondent changes between choosing the delayed reward versus the immediate reward. In cases where the respondent's change between preferring the delayed versus the immediate reward is not consistent, the two questions that are most proportional to their responses are chosen. If the participant always chooses the immediate reward or the delayed reward, the estimation of k is equal to one of the endpoints (0.25 or 0.00016).",,"PX530301",,,,,,,,,,"",""
