Responses to the last three questions were recoded in the following manner: those who responded ""no effect,"" ""a little milder,"" ""moderately milder,"" ""a lot milder,"" or ""don't know"" to the question regarding the effect of blocking on cigarette taste, for example, were classified as being ""unaware."" Similarly, those participants who responded ""no effect,"" ""slightly decrease,"" ""moderately decrease,"" ""greatly decrease,"" or ""don't know"" to the questions regarding the effect of blocking on tar and nicotine yields were also classified as being ""unaware.""

Response percentages were calculated within each brand category, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Between-group tests were done using analyses of variance with Bonferroni adjustments for comparisons or with X2 analyses.30 Within-group comparisons were done with paired t tests. Multiple regression analyses (ordinary least squares, linear probability model) were used to explore predictors of knowledge of vents (scored 1 = yes, 2 = no, don't know) and knowledge that blocking increased tar intake (scored 1 = increase tar, 2 = no effect, decrease tar, don't know). Brand category was included in the regression analyses to adjust for group membership effects. All probability values are for two-sided tests.",,"PX730801",,,,,,,,,,"",""
