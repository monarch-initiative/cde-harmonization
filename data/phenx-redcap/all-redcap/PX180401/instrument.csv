"scoring_180401","px180401_phenx_disinhibiting_behaviors_impulsivity_adolescent_and_a",,"descriptive","Scoring Instructions:

This is a revised version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001). This version, UPPS-P (Lynam, Smith, Whiteside, & Cyders, 2006), assesses positive urgency (Cyders, Smith, Spillane, Fischer, Annus, & Peterson, 2007) in addition to the four pathways assessed in the original version of the scale--urgency (now negative urgency), (lack of) premeditation, (lack of) perseverance, and sensation seeking. The scale uses a 1 (agree strongly) to 4 (disagree strongly) response format. Because the items from different scales run in different directions, it is important to make sure that the correct items are reverse-scored. Typically all of the items are recoded in the direction such that higher scores indicate more impulsive behavior. Therefore, we include the scoring key for (negative) urgency, (lack of) premeditation, (lack of) perseverance, sensation seeking, and positive urgency. For each scale, calculate the mean of the available items; this puts the scales on the same metric. Typically participants must have responded to at least 70% of the items before a score is calculated.
