The next questions are about traditional cigars, cigarillos, and filtered cigars. These products go by lots of different names, so please use these descriptions and photos to understand what they are.

Traditional cigars contain tightly rolled tobacco that is wrapped in a tobacco leaf. Some common brands of cigars include Macanudo®<sup>1</sup>, Romeo y Julieta®<sup>2</sup>, and Arturo Fuente®<sup>3</sup>, but there are many others.

Cigarillos and filtered cigars are smaller than traditional cigars. They are usually brown. Some are the same size as cigarettes, and some come with plastic or wood tips. Some common brands are Black & Mild®<sup>4</sup>, Swisher Sweets®<sup>5</sup>, Dutch Masters®<sup>6</sup>, Phillies Blunts®<sup>7</sup>, Prime Time®<sup>8</sup>, and Winchester®<sup>9</sup>.",,"PX330503",,,,,,,,,,"",""
