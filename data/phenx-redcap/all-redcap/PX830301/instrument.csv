Laboratory Assay for Hemoglobin Characterization

The Sickle Cell Disease Scientific and Research Panel (SRSP) notes that there are numerous different assays and instruments (e.g., hemoglobin electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, high performance liquid chromatography, DNA sequencing analysis) that are appropriate to characterize hemoglobin variants. Once an assay is chosen for a particular study, the SRSP recommends that no changes in the protocol be made over the course of the study. To aid comparability, the SRSP recommends that the investigator record the make and manufacturer of equipment used and the repeatability and coefficients of variation for the assay.

The SRSP notes that investigators should record the assay results for the following hemoglobins (the exact list of hemoglobins that can be distinguished will depend on the assay being used). The hemoglobins are listed in order of the amount present with the most prevalent coming first.
