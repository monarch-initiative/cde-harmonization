The Perceived Availability of Healthy Foods Scale is estimated by taking the average across the three items (note that only respondents with complete information for all three items can be assigned a scale score).

Lower mean scores indicate better availability of healthy foods (i.e., low-fat products, fruits, and vegetables).

Note that in papers by Moore, Diez Roux, and Brines (2008) and Moore et al. (2008) the five-point Likert scale was reported as follows: 0 = strongly agree; 1 = agree; 2 = neither agree nor disagree; 3 = disagree; and 4 = strongly disagree.",,"PX210701",,,,,,,,,,"",""
