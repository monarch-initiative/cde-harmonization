A fasting glucose blood test is performed on all participants 12 years and older who are examined in the morning session after a 9-hour fast.

Note from the Diabetes Working Group: Blood should be collected in an appropriate 10-mL EDTA tube. Invert the tube 3 to 4 times to mix, store on ice and centrifuge within 30 minutes. Processing should yield ~ 4.5 mL of plasma which can then be separated into several 0.5 mL aliquots for multiple different tests.

Venipuncture should generally be performed using the median cubital, cephalic, or basilic veins in the left arm unless this arm is unsuitable. If the veins in the left arm are unsuitable, look for suitable veins on the right arm. If the veins in the antecubital space on both arms are not suitable, then look for veins in the forearm or dorsal side of the hand on the left arm/hand and then the right arm/hand.


Editor's Note: Please review chapter 4 of the Laboratory Procedures Manual from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for a full description of Phlebotomy procedures. 2007-2008 NHANES Lab Manual.

Recording the Results of the Venipuncture Procedure


Immediately after completing the venipuncture, record the results of the blood draw, the reasons for a tube not being drawn according to the protocol, and any comments about the venipuncture.

Note from the Diabetes Working Group: The Diabetes Working Group recommends that the investigator record whether the blood was drawn and whether the full amount was obtained.

Ask the SP to indicate a preference for one of the three flavors. Choose the flavor that matches the preference of the soft drink flavor that he or she prefers. Follow the instructions; remove the correct amount of Trutol® from the bottle before handing the bottle to the SP. Use a small medicine cup to measure the correct amount to remove and discard the excess Trutol®. Hand the SP a cold bottle of Trutol® (containing the calibrated dose) and a straw. SPs MUST consume the entire calibrated dose of the Trutol within 10 minutes.


Recite the script ""Please drink this solution within 10 minutes"" and start the timer. The timer counts down from 10:00 minutes.

When the SP has finished drinking the entire calibrated dose of Trutol®, or cannot continue drinking the Trutol, then stop the timer.

The choices for the amount of solution that the SP consumed are ""All,"" ""Some,"" or ""None.""

Record the amount of solution the SP drank. If the SP drank ""some"" or ""none"" of the Trutol® solution, then the section status is Not Done.

If an SP consumed the entire calibrated dose of the Trutol® solution in 10 minutes, then he or she is eligible to have a 2-ml gray top tube drawn 2 hours, -20 or +15 minutes, after he or she finished consuming the Trutol®. (He or she must maintain the fast until the second blood draw is completed.)

Centrifuge and separate the plasma from the tube as soon as possible. Process the specimen even if the contents of the gray tube clot.

-Separate the plasma by centrifugation.

-Use a calibrated plastic transfer pipette to transfer at least 0.5 mL plasma.

-Determine if the plasma is hemolyzed, turbid, lipemic, or icteric. If so, enter a comment to describe the plasma.

-Close all vessels secured to prevent leakage and evaporation.

Note from the Diabetes Working Group: Plasma should be stored at -80°C until testing and shipped on dry ice to prevent thawing.



Laboratory Assay for Plasma Glucose

The Diabetes Working Group recommends that glucose concentration be determined according to a hexokinase-mediated reaction such as the one developed by the University of Minnesota for use in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: <a href=""https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/toolkit_content/supplemental_info/diabetes/additional_info/Fasting_Glucose_Lab_Assay.pdf"" target=""_blank""> 2007-2008 NHANES Oral Glucose Tolerance Test Lab Assay</a>.

To aid comparability, the Diabetes Working Group recommends that the investigator record the make and manufacturer of equipment used and the repeatability and coefficients of variation for the assay.


Reference Ranges:

Non-fasting glucose concentration normally ranges between 60-139 mg/dL

Fasting plasma glucose concentration normally ranges between 60-100 mg/dL
