Each item is scored on a scale ranging from 1 for ""Strongly Disagree"" to 7 for ""Strongly Agree."" The following items are reverse-scored: 1, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 14 (raw score = 8 minus reverse-keyed item score).

For total score, sum all 14 items and divide by 14. For the higher-order-factor score, sum all items except item 1 and divide by 13.

In a treatment-seeking sample (N = 101), the factor structure of the Heroin Craving Questionnaire-Short Form 14 (HCQ-SF-14) was not consistent with that of the validated 45-item HCQ. The higher-order-factor score can be used as a unidimensional assessment of craving; it correlates with total score on the 45-item HCQ and with visual analog scales for ""crave,"" ""want,"" and ""need"" (Heinz et al., 2006).",,"PX520303",,,,,,,,,,"",""
