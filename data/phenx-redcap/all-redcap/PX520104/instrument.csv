The modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ) uses three multi-item subscales and two single items: ""Smoking Satisfaction"" (items 1, 2, and 12); ""Psychological Reward"" (items 4 through 8); ""Aversion"" (items 9 and 10); ""Enjoyment of Respiratory Tract Sensations"" (item 3); and ""Craving Reduction"" (item 11). Scores for each subscale are calculated as the mean of the individual item responses or the single item. Higher scores indicate greater intensity on that scale.

4= moderately
