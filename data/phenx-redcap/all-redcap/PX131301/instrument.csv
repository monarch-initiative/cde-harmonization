Criteria for ET:

1. On examination, a +2 postural tremor of at least 1 arm (a head tremor may also be present, but is insufficient for the diagnosis)

2. On examination, there must be

a. a +2 kinetic tremor during at least 4 tasks or

b. a +2 kinetic tremor on 1 task and a +3 kinetic tremor on a second task; tasks include: pouring water, using a spoon to drink water, drinking water, finger-to-nose, and drawing a spiral

3. If on examination the tremor is present in the dominant hand, then by report it must interfere with at least 1 activity of daily living (eating, drinking, writing, use of hands); if on examination, the tremor is not present in the dominant hand, this criterion is irrelevant.

4. Medications, hyperthyroidism, alcohol, or dystonia are not potential etiologic factors

5. Not psychogenic (bizarre features, inconsistent in character, changing, subject is distractable, other psychiatric features on examination)

Criteria for probable ET (1 and 3-5 must be true; also, either 2a or 2b must be true):

1. On examination, a +2 postural tremor of arms may or may not be present

2. (a) Same as 2 above

(b) Head tremor is present on examination

3. Tremor in the dominant hand may or may not interfere with at least 1 daily activity

4. Medications, hyperthyroidism, dystonia, or alcohol are not potential etiologic factors

5. Not psychogenic

Criteria for possible ET:

1. On examination, a +2 kinetic tremor must be present on 3 tasks

2. No other stipulations

Tremor Ratings (0 to +3):

0 = no visible tremor

+1 = low-amplitude/barely perceivable tremor or intermittent tremor

+2 = tremor is of moderate amplitude (1-2 cm) and usually present; it is clearly oscillatory

+3 = large-amplitude (>2 cm), violent, jerky tremor resulting in difficulty completing the task due to spilling or inability to hold a pen to paper

Note from the Neurology Working Group: Please see Louis et al. (2001) for discussion on the addition of a tremor rating of 4.",,"PX131301",,,,,,,,,,"",""
