The 48 items of the Marijuana Effect Expectancy Questionnaire (MEEQ) comprise the following 6 scales (Aarons et al., 2001):

(1) Cognitive and Behavioral Impairment: items 14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 33, 36*, 40, 43, and 46

(2) Relaxation and Tension Reduction: items 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 26, 42, and 44

(3) Social and Sexual Facilitation: items 8, 12, 13, 24, 27*, 31, 32*, 45, and 47

(4) Perceptual and Cognitive Enhancement: items 1, 9, 16, 19, 22, 26, 29, and 37

(5) Global Negative Effects: items 11, 23, 25, 28, 30, 34, 35, 38, and 48

(6) Craving and Physical Effects: items 2, 3, 20, 33, 39, and 41

The score for each scale is calculated by averaging the item scores, i.e., totaling the item scores and dividing by the number of items in the scale. Each item is scored on a 1 to 5 scale (Disagree Strongly = 1 and Agree Strongly = 5), except the items marked with an asterisk (*) which should be reverse-scored (Strongly Disagree = 5 and Strongly Agree = 1). Of note, item 26 appears on scales 2 and 4, and item 33 appears on scales 1 and 6. The scoring scheme reflects factors identified in the original publications. Factor structure may differ in individual studies.",,"PX520404",,,,,,,,,,"",""
