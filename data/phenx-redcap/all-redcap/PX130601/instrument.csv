If responses to #1-5 are ""no"", classify as 1 ""improbable TBI"".

If in response to #1-5a and #1-5b reports never having LOC, being dazed or having memory lapses, classify as 1 ""improbable TBI"".

If in response to #1-5b reports being dazed or having a memory lapse, classify as 2 ""possible TBI"".

If in response to #1-5a loss of consciousness (LOC) does not exceed 30 minutes for any injury, classify as 3 ""mild TBI"".

If in response to #1-5a LOC for any one injury is between 30 minutes and 24 hours, classify as 4 ""moderate TBI"".

If in response to #1-5a LOC for any one injury exceeds 24 hours, classify as 5 ""severe TBI"".
