Late (or secondary) graft failure is defined when the recipient meets criteria for initial engraftment but subsequently develops loss of a previously functioning graft by development of at least two lines of cytopenia. Late graft failure is more often associated with allogeneic HCT than with autologous HCT. Some possible causes for late graft failure include graft rejection related to residual host immunity, persistent or progressive disease, low donor cell yield, medication side-effect, infection or GvHD. (Applebaum et al., 2009)
