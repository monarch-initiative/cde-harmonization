Editor's Note: Please review chapter 4 of the Laboratory Procedures Manual from the NHANES for a full description of phlebotomy procedures: 2007-2008 NHANES Lab Manual.

Venipuncture should generally be performed using the median cubital, cephalic, or basilica veins in the left arm unless this arm is unsuitable. If the veins in the left arm are unsuitable, look for suitable veins on the right arm. If the veins in the antecubital space on both arms are not suitable, then look for veins in the forearm or dorsal side of the hand on the left arm/hand and then right arm/hand.",,"PX160701",,,,,,,,,,"",""
