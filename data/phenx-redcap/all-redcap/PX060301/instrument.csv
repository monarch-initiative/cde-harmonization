"residence_intro","px060301_phenx_residential_history",,"descriptive","Ask the respondent about current and previous residences in which he/she has lived for 3 months or longer. Begin with the current residence and complete one row for each residence. Geocoordinates are obtained after the interview is completed by entering the complete address into a web-based geocoding tool such as the one developed by the University of Southern California's GIS Research Laboratory at http://webgis.usc.edu/Services/Geocode. Utilize this or a similar tool or other reliable geocoding databases to determine the geocoordinates for each residence. The accuracy of geocoordinates may also be improved by using the geocode correction tool.",,"PX060301",,,,,,,,,,"",""
