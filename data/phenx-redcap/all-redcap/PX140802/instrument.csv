This protocol provides basic information for measuring blood glucose concentrations using a glucose meter or glucometer. Participants are asked to fast for at least 9 hours (generally overnight) prior to the test.",,"PX140802",,,,,,,,,,"",""

If the 9-hour fast is not met, the Diabetes Working Group recommends that the test can still be completed as a ""casual"" glucose concentration (see protocol for casual glucose reference ranges for screening plus/minus Diabetes).
