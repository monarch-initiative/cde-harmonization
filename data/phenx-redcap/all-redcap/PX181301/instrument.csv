The 51-item scale may be broken down into 13 subscales as shown in the table below. 
For each item, a response of 
not true = 0, 
somewhat true = 1, 
and very true = 2. 

Calculate the score from each individual subscale. Of the two methods to obtain an overall score, the first is to add up all very trues or very trues and somewhat trues. However, if a person does not have a particular role (e.g., parent), then the question is scored with a zero (see subscale table for universal vs. role-specific designations). 
The other method is to code the items as missing if a respondent is not in the role and therefore was not asked these questions, and then take the average of all subscales. The scores cannot simply be added up because the total is confounded by the number of roles the person is in and that is a proxy for social competence, therefore cutting across the point of the scale.",,"PX181301",,,,,,,,,,"",""
