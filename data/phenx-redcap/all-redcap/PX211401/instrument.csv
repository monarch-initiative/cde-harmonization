The technical documentation for the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses are available online at American Factfinder (http://factfinder.census.gov). Select Data Sets link, and then select Decennial Census. Different tabs allow the user to select 2000 or 1990 data and/or materials. Specific data sets are then selected by clicking in data-specific radio buttons (e.g., for Census 2000 options, include SF1 or SF3). SF1 refers to Summary File 1 (the short form of the U.S. Census collected on everyone, and referred to as 100% data), and SF3 refers to Summary File 3 (the long form of the U.S. Census collected on detailed population and housing variables from a one-in-six [16%-17%] sample and weighted to represent the total population). For each data set, the user can create tables and maps, extract data, or consult technical documentation. Users not familiar with Census data should consult the technical materials. The technical documentation for SF1 and SF3 data sets are available at the U.S. Census Bureau website:

Race and Ethnicity data can be found in SF1 and SF3 (as well as other Census data products). Here, we focus on SF1 and data based on the 100% sample in 2000.

The key race/ethnicity data in SF1 (100%) are found in ""Table P8. Hispanic or Latino by Race."" This table is preferred over other possible race and race/ethnic tables available, as it provides data on the main race/ethnic groups in the United States and explicitly incorporates data on Hispanic or Latino populations, otherwise not available in the race-only tables.

The race/ethnic data are available for all small census geographies--such as census block, census block group, and census tract--and can be easily extracted for almost any geographic level.

The Dissimilarity Index provides data on larger areas (e.g., metropolitan statistical areas) using smaller level data.

The most common conceptualization of residential segregation is based on the dimension of evenness. Evenness refers to the differential distribution of the subject population across neighborhoods in a large area (e.g., metropolitan area). It ranges from 0 (complete integration) to 1 (complete segregation) and indicates the percentage of a group's population that would have to change residence for each neighborhood to have the same percentage of that group as the metropolitan area overall. It is computed as:",,"PX211401",,,,,,,,,,"",""

n is the number of tracts in the larger area (e.g., a metropolitan area),

xi is the population size of the minority group of interest in tract i,

yi is the population of the reference group (usually non-Hispanic Whites) in tract i, and,

Y is the population of the reference group in the larger area (e.g., metropolitan) area as a whole.

The calculation requires the computation of the totals for each group across all subareas within a larger region (e.g., all census tracts within a county), the proportion of each group within each subarea, the absolute difference between the proportions, and the sum of the absolute differences. The latter number is multiplied by 0.5 to generate a result between 0.0 and 1.0. A value of 0.0 would indicate there were the same proportions of majority and minority group populations in each subarea, as in the larger regions' population. If all subareas within the region contain members of just one group (i.e., there is no co-residence) then D equals 1.0, indicating complete segregation.

Extending the Dissimilarity Index: The Multigroup Analog

While much early research on segregation looked at two groups (e.g., Black and White, or majority and minority), today's society is multiethnic. Two-group measures are useful but limited for describing complex patterns of segregation. The choice to use a two-group or multigroup D depends on the specific question of interest. In a region where the population is composed of three groups (e.g., White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic), we may be interested in

a) segregation between two specific groups (e.g., How segregated are White from Black residents?); or

b) segregation among all three groups (e.g., How segregated are White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic residents from each other?).

The two-group measure can still be used by comparing all possible pairs of population groups (Morrill, 1995), but these are not comprehensive, and multiple groups are not treated simultaneously. To address segregation among multiple groups requires a multigroup analog to D (Morgan et al., 1975; Sakoda, 1981). The multigroup analog describes the extent to which two or more population groups are similarly distributed among subareas. The formula for multigroup dissimilarity (from Reardon & Firebaugh, 2002) is:",,"PX211401",,,,,,,,,,"",""

Researchers have extended segregation measures by incorporating the spatial dimension (see White, 1983; Wong, 1993; Reardon & O'Sullivan, 2004). There are spatially modified versions of the D index (see Wong, 1993).",,"PX211401",,,,,,,,,,"",""
