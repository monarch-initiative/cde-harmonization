The tube should be allowed to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to clot. The sample should then be spun at 2,000 rpm (room temperature: 20-24oC) for 10 minutes to separate off the serum.

The serum should be aliquoted in 1.8 ml screw-top cryogenic microcontainer tubes (0.5 cc minimum per tube).
