Scores ranging from 0 to 3 were applied for the positive predictors and from 3 to 0 (reversed order, where 3 = none) for negative predictors. The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) score was calculated as the sum of these scores, giving a total score ranging from 0 to 18. Those with a score of 8 or more have a high likelihood of having Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), and those with less than 8 have low or no likelihood. For more detailed scoring information, see the reference in the Source section..",,"PX191101",,,,,,,,,,"",""
