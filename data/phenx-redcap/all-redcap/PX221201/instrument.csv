BMI = [Weight (kg) ÷ (Stature (cm) x Stature (cm))] x 10,000

BMI = [ 70 kg ÷ (180 cm x 180 cm)] x 10,000 = [70 ÷ 32,400] x 10,000 = 0.002160 x 10,000 = 21.60

- Find the child's age on the horizontal axis. When plotting weight-for-length, find the length on the horizontal axis. Use a straight edge or right-angle ruler to draw a vertical line up from that point.

For example, when the dot is plotted on the 95th percentile line on the CDC BMI-for-age growth chart, it means that 5 of 100 children (5%) of the same age and sex in the reference population have a higher BMI-for-age.

The WHO growth standard charts use the 2nd and the 98th percentiles as the outer most percentile cutoff values indicating abnormal growth.

The CDC growth reference charts use the 5th and the 95th percentiles as the outermost percentile cutoff values indicating abnormal growth.

Interpret the plotted measurements based on the percentile ranking on the WHO or the CDC growth charts and the percentile cutoff value corresponding to the nutrition indicator shown in the table below. If the percentile rank indicates a nutrition-related health concern, additional monitoring and assessment are recommended.

&#149; Determine the percentile rank.

&#149; Determine if the percentile rank suggests that the anthropometric index is indicative of nutritional risk based on the percentile cutoff value.

&#149; Compare today's percentile rank with the rank from previous visits to identify any major shifts in the child's growth pattern and the need for further assessment.

When transitioning from the WHO growth charts to the CDC growth charts at aged 2 years, a change in growth classification may occur. During this transition, caution should be used in interpreting any changes in classification.",,"PX221201",,,,,,,,,,"",""
