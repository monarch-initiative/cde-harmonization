"scoring_630302","px630302_phenx_ptsd_symptoms_selfreport_dsm_5",,"descriptive","Scoring:

Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = Not at all; 4 = Extremely) indicating how much the participant has been bothered by the event in the past month. A total symptom severity score can be obtained by totaling the scores of the 20 individual items. Preliminary validation work suggests a cut-off score of 38 for PTSD screening.


DSM-5 symptom cluster severity scores can be calculated according to the following:

Cluster B - sum items 1-5
Cluster C - sum items 6-7
Cluster D - sum items 8-14
Cluster E - sum items 15-20
A provisional PTSD diagnosis can be made by counting each item rated as 2 (""Moderately"") or higher as a symptom endorsement, then following the DSM-5 diagnostic rule, which requires at least 1 item from cluster B (questions 1-5), 1 item from cluster C (questions 6-7), 2 items from cluster D (questions 8-14), and 2 items from cluster E (questions 15-20).

Interpretation of the PCL-5 should be made by a clinician.

Change scores for PCL-5 have not yet been documented, but it is expected that reliable and clinically meaningful change will be in a similar range to the scores established for the PCL for DSM-IV (reliable > 5; clinically meaningful > 10).",,"PX630302",,,,,,,,,,"",""
