Positive and negative behaviors were mixed together in random order when presented to subjects. The interviewer should ask the following lead-in statements about the respondent and their smoking status.

We are interested in finding out if certain events have happened to you since (this program started/since you have been trying to quit smoking). We have included a broad range of events that can apply to spouses, relatives, or friends. If you are married or living with a romantic partner, please answer with respect to how that person responded to you and your quitting efforts. If not, pick the person - friend or relative - who followed your progress in quitting most closely, and answer in terms of how that person responded to you.
