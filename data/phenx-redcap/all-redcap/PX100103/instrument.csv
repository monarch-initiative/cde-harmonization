We would like to assess the stage of your daughter's physical development using the drawings on the next pages. These indicate various stages of puberty commonly used by doctors to assess the growth and development of girls.

We need to know which drawings most closely match your daughter's stage of development at the moment.

Not all children follow the same pattern of development. Just pick the stage that is closest, based on both the picture and the description.

The drawings below show different amounts of female pubic hair. A girl can go through each of these five stages shown. Please look at each of the drawings. It is also important to read the description. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
