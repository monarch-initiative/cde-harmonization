Identifying Intracranial Landmarks and Major Cerebral Arteries

Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography provides visual landmarks to help correctly identify intracranial blood vessels. Correct identification of intracranial vessels relies on the diameter of the head, position of the transducer, angle of the transducer, depth of the Doppler sample, and direction of the blood flow. In adults, the diameter of the head is assumed to be 130-140 mm, whereas the head diameter must be measured due to variation of children's head sizes. In children, the bitemporal diameter is measured so that the location of the midline can be calculated (half of the diameter of the head). The internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation is the landmark that is the reference point for all other intracranial anatomy. The depth of the ICA bifurcation is estimated to usually be 10 to12 millimeters shallower than the midline.

Recording Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography Results

The results of the TCD are spectral waveform plots of velocity vs. time and the calculated velocity is the time averaged mean of the maximum velocity. Examiners should record the highest time-averaged mean blood-flow velocity in 2-millimeter increments in the following arteries:

*middle cerebral artery (at three points),
*distal internal carotid artery,
*anterior and posterior cerebral arteries, and
*basilar artery.",,"PX821001",,,,,,,,,,"",""
