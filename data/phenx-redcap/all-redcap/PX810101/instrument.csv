Tympanic Body Temperature:
• There are many different types of ear thermometers that are appropriate for this protocol. Investigators should follow the manufacturer's recommendations for calibration and measurement.

• To decrease the likelihood of obtaining a falsely low reading, visually check the thermometer for dirt or damage before and after each use.

• If using alcohol wipes or wet cloths to clean the probe tip, exercise caution as these items can have a cooling effect.

• Place the thermometer probe into the ear canal according to the manufacturer guidelines.

• Read the thermometer and record the temperature.

Normal Body Temperature:
Method \ Degrees Fahrenheit \ Degrees Celsius
Tympanic \ 96.1 to 99.3 \ 35.6 to 37.40
