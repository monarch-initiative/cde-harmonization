Children above the age of 10 and adults can self-collect the urine. The specimen should be refrigerated immediately after collection. Aliquot 3mLs into a 4 mL cryovial. Freeze the cryovial at -20°C until analysis. If the samples need to be stored greater than 1 year, freeze at -80°C.

Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is the preferred method to accurately measure cotinine in urine samples. (See source references for details.) The limit of detection is 0.20 ng/mL. A result of 100 ng/mL urinary cotinine or more is indicative of an active smoker.",,"PX091701",,,,,,,,,,"",""
