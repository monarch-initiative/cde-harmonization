a) Describe the position.

Script: ""I would like you to try to stand on one leg for 30 seconds. You may stand on either leg, whichever is more comfortable. I'll demonstrate.""

b) Demonstrate the one leg stand by lifting the opposite leg so that the toes are about 2 inches off the floor. The knee should be flexed. While demonstrating say:

Script: ""Try to hold your foot up until I say stop. If you lose your balance put your foot down.""

c) Allow the participant to hold onto your arm to get balanced. Say:

Script: ""Hold onto my arm while you get in position. When you are ready, let go.""

Start timing when the participant lets go.

Stop the stopwatch if they take a step or grab a support. Record to 0.01 second how long participant is able to hold this position.

Say, ""STOP"" after 30 seconds.

d) If the participant holds the position for 30 seconds, stop the exam. Otherwise, perform a second trial of the One Leg Stand.
