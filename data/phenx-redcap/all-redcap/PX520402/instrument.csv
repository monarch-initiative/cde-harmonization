The 46 items of the Stimulant Effect Expectancy Questionnaire (SEEQ) comprise the following 5 scales (Aarons et al., 2001):

(1) Global Positive Effects: items 2, 10, 22, 23, 25, 28, 37, 44, 45, and 46

(2) Global Negative Effects: items 3, 8, 9, 27, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, and 43

(3) General Arousal: items 6, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, and 42

(4) Anxiety: items 1, 4, 5, 13, 16, 18, 19, and 41

(5) Relaxation and Tension Reduction: items 7, 11, 24, and 31

The score for each scale is calculated by averaging the item scores, i.e., totaling the item scores and dividing by the number of items in the scale. Each item is scored on a 1 to 5 scale (Disagree Strongly = 1 and Agree Strongly = 5). Of note, items 26 and 30 are not scored. The scoring scheme reflects factors identified in the original publications. Factor structure may differ in individual studies.",,"PX520402",,,,,,,,,,"",""
