2. Ensure that the equipment has been properly calibrated at the start of each day.

3. Ensure that the equipment is turned on and warmed up for at least 30 minutes prior to using it with a participant.

4. Ask the participant to lie down and rest quietly for about 30 minutes.

5. If the participant feels cold, offer him/her a blanket. If the participant feels hot, alter the environment to insure that he/she does not sweat.

6. Check that the monitor is in canopy mode. Change if needed (This may differ between instruments).

7. Check that the monitor is in the artifact suppression mode with a 10 min start delay. (This may differ between instruments).

8. Check that the hoses from the hood to the metabolic monitor are connected and the unit is turned on.

9. Perform a calibration of the metabolic monitor, as needed.

10. After the initial 30 minute rest period, measure the resting metabolic rate as per instrument instructions.

11. The printer should be reporting data on a minute by minute basis. If it is not printing, check the connections, printer power, or see the PRINTER SETUP.

• The participant must remain at rest but not sleep. We recommend that you speak to the participant if you feel it is necessary to keep him/her from falling asleep. If that approach is not effective, then a second attempt could be made by a gentle ""nudge."" It is important that staff are careful not to startle participants in doing this; however as this could cause an increased heart rate, thereby affecting the test. Participant should always be warned verbally in advance of a physical contact.

• Use of classical music and a relaxing poster over the bed are acceptable methods for keeping participants calm during the indirect calorimetry test. However, please do not use videos or any other strategies for relaxation

• The participant must not talk, except when necessary to communicate a potential problem. If the participant does talk, lift their arms to scratch an itch, shift their weight to prevent stiffness etc., indicate the time and movement on the printout using a pen or pencil.

• Confirm that the participant is still thermally comfortable.

• If the participant has to get up because he/she needs to use the bathroom, then the measurement can be terminated, but the participant will need to start over. The measurement sequence (i.e., steps 3-13) needs to be repeated beginning with a 10 min rest in place of the 30 min called for in the basic protocol.",,"PX230301",,,,,,,,,,"",""

14. End the measurement.

15. Obtain the output data from the metabolic cart (time, VO2, VCO2, RQ, Energy Expenditure). Save the readings on a disk or other electronic format. If electronic output not available, staff will enter output onto Excel spreadsheet.

16. Remove the hood from over the participant's head.

17. Ask the participant to sit upright.

18. Help the participants to their feet and be sure that they are steady. Remember that they have fasted and there is a small risk of hypoglycemia.

Loss of flow due to a rare failure of the fan in the metabolic cart or due to a loose hose will cause discomfort and in an extreme case may cause asphyxiation. Although an alarm will sound if the unit does not detect breathing, the metabolic cart technician should remain with the participant throughout the measurement. Care should also be exercised when the participant stands-up after the measurement should dizziness develop secondary to the fast.",,"PX230301",,,,,,,,,,"",""
