While bending forward the individual has their feet together, knees straight, and their arms dangling by their sides. If signs of scoliosis are observed, an x-ray with Cobb technique is recommended. Signs of scoliosis include imbalances in the rib cage (i.e., one side is higher than the other), and other deformities along the back.",,"PX221601",,,,,,,,,,"",""

The angle between them is measured by drawing a line from the top of the superior end vertebra parallel to the upper endplate, and another line from the bottom of the inferior end vertebra parallel to the lower endplate. Perpendicular lines are then constructed at right angles to the lines along the endplates. The angle formed by the intersection of the perpendicular lines defines the Cobb angle. This angle is then compared to a standard scale in order to determine whether or not the curvature is potentially harmful. Individuals with a straight spine have zero degree curve.",,"PX221601",,,,,,,,,,"",""
