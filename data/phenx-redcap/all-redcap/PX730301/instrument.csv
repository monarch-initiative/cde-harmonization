  a. Calibrate the pH meter using buffers 4.01 and 7.00 according to TL-EQUIP.075, pH Meter Monograph, or TL-EQUIP.200, Sirius Vinotrate Monograph.
  b. The Sirius Vinotrate uses a standing wash solution. Use the 50% methanol/water solution for this wash.
  c. Verify the calibration by measuring the buffer solutions at pH 4.01, 7.00, and 10.01. If the buffer pH measurements are not within ± 0.05, recalibrate the meter. If the meter fails more than twice, change the buffer and clean the electrode, if necessary, prior to re-calibrating. If the pH values continue to fall outside the range, replace the electrode. If poor system performance continues, remove the instrument from service according TL-EQUIP.010, Equipment, and contact the instrument vendor. Initiate corrective action, if needed, according toTL-ADMIN.050, Nonconformances and Corrective Action.
  d. At the conclusion of each run, analyze a check sample using pH buffer 4.01. The pH must be within the acceptable range of 4.01 ± 0.05 for the run to be accepted.
    i. If the check sample fails criteria, determine if the pH measuring device is functioning properly. If it is not, remove the instrument from service as described above.
   ii. If the pH measuring device is functioning properly, samples may be reanalyzed one time.
   iii. If the check samples on re-analysis, initiate corrective action according to the TL-ADMIN.050, Nonconformances and Corrective Action.
  e. Determine the appropriate volume for the pH measurement device used. For the Sirius Vinotrate, 10 ml deionized/distilled water should be used with the appropriate autosampler vial. For the Pinnacle Series pH meter, 20 ml deionized/distilled water should be used with a 40 ml sample vial.
  f. Weigh 1.00 ± 0.01 g of tobacco product for every 10 ml of deionized/distilled water used. Record the weight on TL-METHOD.035.F04, pH for Nicotine.

  c. Grind the Nicotiana glauca for at least 30 seconds, until the sample appears visually uniform.
  d. This blank material is used for preparation of analytical blanks and calibration standards.
  e. The authenticity of the material is confirmed by full scan GC/MS analysis. The Nicotiana glauca samples contain high levels of anabasine and no appreciable nicotine peak.
  f. The analyst records confirmation by circling and labeling the two regions, as well as initialing and dating the spectrum. The resulting record is stored in the same location as TL-METHOD.035.F07, Nicotine Blank Preparation Log.
  g. Quantitatively verify the blank material by evaluating the y-intercept of the first calibration curve. Check the value to make sure it is below the most recently established limit of detection.
3. Sample Preparation

  a. Sample material is stored in -20°C freezer if analysis is planned within 6 months of receipt. For longer-term storage, material is stored in a 70°C freezer.
  b. Prior to analysis, remove samples from the freezer and allow them to equilibrate to room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
  c. Prepare two QC samples and at least two tobacco blanks for every analytical run. For the calibration curve, two QC samples, two tobacco blanks (at the beginning of the sequence and after the highest calibrator), and the calibration standards are analyzed in each batch. One QC sample may consist of reference tobacco CRP2, and the other may consist of CRP3.
  d. Weigh 1.00 ± 0.01 g of tobacco, and record the weight on TL-METHOD.035.F05, Nicotine Run Sheet. Transfer the sample to an amber bottle.
  e. Add 5 ml of 2N NaOH to the amber bottle. Wait 15 to 20 minutes, then add 50 ml of MTBE extraction solution to the bottle.
  f. Cap the bottle and place it horizontal on an orbital shaker set for 120 min at 160 rpm.
  g. Transfer 1.5 ml of the extract from the amber bottle into a 2.0 ml autosampler vial.
  h. Prepared samples can be stored in a 4°C refrigerator for up to two weeks prior to analysis.
4. Preliminary System Setup

  a. Ensure that the valve on the helium cylinder is open and that the pressure on the tank regulator is greater than 500 psi.
  b. Use the autotune function in ChemStation to tune the mass spectrometer using the instrument's internal perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) standard.
  c. Further manually tune the instrument to set the mass resolution and the abundance for the ion at mass 69. The Mass Spectrometer Set Up Parameters are found in work instruction METHOD.035.W01, Instrumentation for Nicotine Analysis.

5. Calibration Curve

  a. Calibration curves are created each time a new batch of MTBE solution is prepared or a major instrument repair is performed, such as installation of a new ion source or column.
  b. To create calibration samples, spike 400 µl of each calibration standard into a corresponding 1 g sample of blank tobacco.
  c. Extract the calibration sample by adding 5 ml of 2N NaOH to the amber bottle. Wait 15 minutes, and then add 50ml of MTBE extraction solution to the bottle.
  d. Cap the bottle and place it horizontal on an orbital shaker set for 120 min at 160 rpm.
  e. Transfer 1.5 ml of the extract from the amber bottle into a 2.0ml autosampler vial.

  b. Peaks are automatically integrated using the ChemStation RTE integrator.

8. Quality assessment

  a. The following experimental checks are made on the stability of the analytical system with each run.
  b. Analyze the initial blank for visible peaks that may signify contamination in the system, spiking solutions, or reagents.
  c. Analyze the QC standards.
     i. The internal standard responses should be within ± 50% of the response from the previous calibration.
   ii. The signal to noise ratios should be > 100, and the retention time should be ± 0.5 minutes from the previous QC run.
  d. Visually check to see if any single standard appears to be an outlier
   i. In order to discard an outlier, calculate the average response ratio of mass 133 divided by mass 102 for the 10 calibration standards. Use a relative 20% setting for the acceptance criteria in the Calibrate-Edit Compounds menu.
  ii. If removal of a point changes the slope or intercept by more than 10%, it is considered an outlier.
  iii. No more than one calibration standard may be discarded.
  iv. If either the high or low standard is removed, adjust the reporting limits to reflect the new reporting ranges.
e. Check the regression analysis of the calibration curve to confirm that R2is ? 0.98.
f. Review automated peak integration and record manual integrations according to TL-LABOP.015, Chromatographic Peak Integration. Use the QEdit function to manually integrate peaks, if needed. No more than 10% of peaks within a run should require manual integration.",,"PX730301",,,,,,,,,,"",""
