"socring181202","px181202_phenx_crime_and_delinquency_adult_protocol","Scoring","descriptive","Typically researchers use this information to capture which criminal and delinquent activities occurred and the prevalence during the last year.

Scoring can take the form of counting up the number of items endorsed or by calculating the sum of the item frequencies, where the nonendorsed items are scored ""0"". In addition, types of antisocial and criminal behaviors can be assessed (alcohol and drug use, minor delinquency, serious delinquency, violence, etc.). A Guttman scale may be used to classify the more serious or violent offenses (see Loeber et al., 1998). Researchers should consult with the original sources and other publication for examples of scoring techniques.

If a summary delinquency scale is being prepared, the Psychosocial Working Group recommends that items that are not against the law be removed from the scale (e.g., ran away, lied about age [unless some illegal context is specified], provided false name or alias [unless some illegal context is specified]). In addition, items that overlap, such as stealing something worth $5 to $100 and taking something from the store without paying (shoplifting) should not count as two endorsed items, only one.",,"PX181202",,,,,,,,,,"",""
