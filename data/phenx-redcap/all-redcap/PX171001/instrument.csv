A lens opacity (cataract) in either eye, ever, whether primary or secondary to steroid therapy, documented by ophthalmoscopy.

Retinal change:

Seizures:

Paroxysmal electrical discharge occurring in the brain and producing characteristic physical changes including tonic and clonic movements and certain behavioral disorders. Only seizures requiring therapy for 6 months are counted as damage.
