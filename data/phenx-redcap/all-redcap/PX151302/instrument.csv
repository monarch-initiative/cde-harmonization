Using the scales below please indicate how confident you are that you could exercise in the event that any of the following circumstances were to occur.

Please indicate the degree to which you are confident that you could exercise in the event that any of the following circumstances were to occur by selecting the appropriate %. Select the response that most closely matches your own, remembering that there are no right or wrong answers.

For example, in question #1 if you have complete confidence that you could exercise even if ""the weather was very bad,"" you would select 100%. If, however, you had no confidence at all that you could exercise, if you failed to make or continue making progress (that is, confidence you would not exercise), you would select 0.
