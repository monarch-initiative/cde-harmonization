Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm, just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.  Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  Have you made a suicide attempt?  Have you done anything to harm yourself?  Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  What did you do?  Did you___ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you___?  Were you trying to end your life when you ___?  Or did you think it was possible you could have died from___?
