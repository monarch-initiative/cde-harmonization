PsAID12 SCORING AND CALCULATION RULES

The PsAID is calculated based on 12 Numerical rating scales (NRS) questions. Each NRS is assessed as a number between 0 and 10.

Calculation

PsAID final value =

 (PsAID1 (pain) NRS value (range 0-10) x 3)

+ (PsAID2 (fatigue) NRS value (range 0-10) x 2)

+ (PsAID3 (skin) NRS value (range 0-10) x 2)

+ (PsAID4 (Work and/or leisure activities) NRS value (range 0-10) x 2)

+ (PsAID5 (function) NRS value (range 0-10) x 2)

+ (PsAID6 (discomfort) NRS value (range 0-10) x 2)

+ (PsAID7 (sleep) NRS value (range 0-10) x 2)

+ (PsAID8 (coping) NRS value (range 0-10) x 1)

+ (PsAID9 (anxiety) NRS value (range 0-10) x 1)

+ (PsAID10 (embarrassment) NRS value (range 0-10) x 1)

+ (PsAID11 (social life) NRS value (range 0-10) x 1)

+ (PsAID12 (depression) NRS value (range 0-10) x 1)

The total is divided by 20.

Thus, the range of the final PsAID value is 0-10 where higher figures indicate worse status.

Missing data imputation

If one of the 12 NRS values composing the PsAID is missing, the imputation is as follows:

calculate the mean value of the 11 other (non-missing) NRS (range, 0-10) impute this value for the missing NRS.

Then, calculate the PsAID as explained above.

If 2 or more of the NRS are missing, the PsAID is considered as missing value (no imputation).",,"PX172001",,,,,,,,,,"",""
