The coordinator explains the following instructions to the subject before urine collection:

- Wash hands with soap and water.
- It is important that the cup and cap not touch or come into contact with any parts of the body, clothing, or external surfaces.
- Close container to minimize exposure to air.

Refrigerate all insufficient urine samples. When additional urine is obtained, pool the urine, mix, and process.
