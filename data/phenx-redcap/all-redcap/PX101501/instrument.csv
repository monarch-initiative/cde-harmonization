1. Gently grasp the testicle between the thumb and third finger while holding the beads in the opposite hand. Manipulate the testis to expose it for comparison as shown.*

Opposing the fingertips just behind the testis should result in gentle stretching of the scrotal skin over the anterior surface of the testis, permitting more accurate measurement.

2. Start with a bead that is likely to be smaller than the testicle.

While maintaining the grasp, maneuver to a bead with a higher number to assess for a better match.

3. Further check by comparing with the next larger bead. Then record the number of the largest bead that the testis is at least as large as. If the testis size is between beads, record the number on the smaller bead.

Repeat for the opposite testis. Record right and left separately.",,"PX101501",,,,,,,,,,"",""
