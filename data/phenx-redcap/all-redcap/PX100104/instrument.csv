intro_text_male,px100104_assessment_of_pubertal_development_male_parent,,descriptive,"Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), Growing and Changing, Parent/Son Questionnaire

We would like to assess the stage of your son's physical development using the drawings on the next pages. These show various stages commonly used by doctors to assess the growth and development of boys.

We need to know which drawings most closely match your son's stage of development at the moment.

Not all children follow the same pattern of development. Just pick the stage that is closest, based on both the picture and the description.

Boys go through the various stages of physical development at different ages. Some start as early as 6, others not until they are 20. We need your help in letting us know what stage you son is at. Please look at each of the drawings. It is also important to read the descriptions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
