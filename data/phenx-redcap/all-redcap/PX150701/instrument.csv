Hi, I'm __________ and this is _____________. We're from ____ and we'd like to give you this questionnaire that will tell us about the activity you've done for the past three days.

[Hand out surveys and make sure every student has survey and pen/pencil.]

On the first page you'll see several pictures of commonly performed activities categorized by intensity level:

       Light Activities- require little or no movement with slow breathing
       Moderate Activities- require some movement and normal breathing 
       Hard Activities- require a moderate amount of movement and increased breathing
       Very Hard Activities- require quick movements and hard breathing.
If you turn the page, you'll see a bunch of activities listed, each with its own number. You're going to use these numbers to identify the activities that you did. So, if you ate a meal, you're going to use the number ""one"" to identify that activity. Before we get started, I want to point out a few things. Please notice that walking is listed twice (#18 and #53) because it can be done for different reasons; transportation or exercise. Also note that if you performed a physical activity or sport that is not listed, you may choose #55 (Other) and write in the activity that you did. Remember, we're only talking about PHYSICAL activity. Some people say they ""slept hard last night"" or they had ""hard homework"". While you may be thinking hard while doing your homework, it would not be considered hard physical activity because you're not moving and breathing harder.

At the bottom of this page there's a small example of how we would like you to use this list of activities. Each row represents a 1/2 hour, starting from 7 a.m. and going all the way to midnight. In the first column, labeled 'Activity Number' you're going to write down the number of the main activity you did for that 1/2 hour block of time. Only one activity number can be entered into each block. Once you've written down that number, put an 'x' in only one intensity box that best describes the intensity of this activity. Remember the definitions of light, moderate, hard, and very hard. If you need to, check the first page or ask if you're not sure how the activity should be rated.

So, going through this example at the bottom, we see that this person took a shower from 7:00 'til 7:30 so they wrote #22 in the first time block. They classified this activity as light by putting a check in the 'light' column. From 7:30 to 8:00, this person did activity #21 which is getting ready (combing hair, doing make-up). They indicated that this activity was done at a light intensity. Does anyone have a question about filling out the time blocks?

O.K. think about your activities starting with yesterday, Tuesday. Think about what you were doing between 7:00 and 7:30 that morning. Were you still sleeping, getting ready for school or doing something else? Find the number in the list that corresponds to that activity and put that number in the first box. Now, mark the box that applies to the intensity level of that activity. Now think about what you did for the next half-hour, from 7:30-8:00. Write down the activity number and check the appropriate intensity box. Please be as honest and accurate as you can. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. Fill out the rest of the sheet for Tuesday and then do the same thing for Monday and Sunday.

[Walk around the room to see how the students are doing and provide cues.]
[Wait about 10 minutes]

If you're done with Tuesday, turn the page and do the same thing for Monday. Now think about what you did Monday morning from 7:00-7:30. Fill out this sheet for Monday the same way you did for Tuesday.

[Walk around the room to see how the students are doing and provide cues.]
[Wait about 10 minutes]

O.K., once you're done with Monday, you're going to do the same thing for Sunday. Think about what you did Sunday morning from 7:00-7:30. Did you get up early for church or were you able to sleep in this past Sunday? Go ahead and fill out the rest of this sheet for Sunday and then put your pencil down and wait once you are done.

       
[Walk around the room to see how the students are doing and provide cues.]

All right, you're almost done. Just flip the last page, answer the questions there and you're done!

       
[Check each 3DPAR as they are turned in]

Ainsworth, B. E., Haskell, W. L., Whitt, M. C., Irwin, M. L., Swartz, A. M., Strath, S. J., O'Brien, W. L., Bassett, D. R., Jr., Schmitz, K. H., Emplaincourt, P. O., Jacobs, D. R., Jr., & Leon, A. S. (2000). Compendium of Physical Activities: An update of activity codes and MET intensities. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. 32 (Suppl):S498-S516.
 
Scoring the results in the worksheet involves the use of a specialized grid of the metabolic equivalent task (MET) values and the level of intensity. These values were assigned to each activity and intensity level based on the Compendium of Physical Activities (Ainsworth et al. 2000). The scorer should use the following table (which has been used on other studies) to assign a MET value to each 30 minute entry in the worksheet. If the activity does not appear on the table the scorer should assign a value to the activity from the latest version of the Compendium of Physical Activities. If the respondent enters an intensity that is incompatible (e.g., intensity level of hard"" for ""meal"") the scorer should assign a MET value of the adjacent cell with a low intensity activity. Similarly, use the adjacent cell for a high intensity activity. If four or more activities on a worksheet are incompatible the worksheet is considered invalid.
 
Sum the METs over each day to obtain an average value for total physical activity per day (METs Day-1). Sum blocks of moderate to vigorous physical activity (abbreviated MVPA, = 3 METs) and vigorous activity (abbreviated VPA, = 6 METs) for each day. Three day averages for METs Day-1, MVPA blocks Day-1, and VPA blocks Day-1 may be calculated.
 
Note: Although the following table includes 70 activities and there are 59 activities on the form you can match the activity from the 3 Day PAR results with the METS value in the table.",,"PX150701",,,,,,,,,,"",""
