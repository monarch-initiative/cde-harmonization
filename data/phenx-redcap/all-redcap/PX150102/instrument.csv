Ask the study participant to warm up by walking on a treadmill at 0% grade at a brisk, but comfortable pace of 2 to 4.5 mph for 4 minutes. The warm up pace should produce a heart rate that is 50-70% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate (220 - age in years). After 4 minutes at 0% grade, begin the test by increasing the grade of the treadmill to 5%, start the stopwatch. The speed should remain the same for 4 minutes at the 5% grade. Heart rate from a heart-rate monitor should be obtained for the last 15 sec of the test. Record the speed, heart rate, age, and gender into the following scoring equation to determine predicted relative VO2max (maximal oxygen consumption)",,"PX150102",,,,,,,,,,"",""
