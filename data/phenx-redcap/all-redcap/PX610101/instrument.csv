INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUTH

There are thirteen areas of behavior for you to rate from 0 (No problem) to 4 (Very bad problem) for you. Rate each item by checking the number that best describes your behavior at the present time. Since your behavior will change over time, only take into consideration how you feel your recent behavior (within the past week or two) has been. PLEASE RATE ALL THIRTEEN ITEMS. Check the number 5 if you don't know or the question does not apply to you. If you do not understand an item or items ask the staff person to clarify it for you. S/he will be glad to do so.",,"PX610101",,,,,,,,,,"",""
