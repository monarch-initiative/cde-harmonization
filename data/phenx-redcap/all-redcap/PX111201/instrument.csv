Participants should answer all the questions as if the participant is wearing his/her glasses or contact lenses (if any).

An Appendix of additional questions may be added to address other sub-scales of vision-targeted health-related quality of life. For example, if a user is testing a new treatment for macular degeneration, by adding near vision questions A3, A4, and A5 to VFQ-25 questions 5, 6, and 7, the investigator would have a six-item near vision scale rather than a three-item scale. The addition of these items would enhance the reliability of the near vision sub-scale and is likely to improve the responsiveness of the sub-scale to the intervention over time. If items from the appendix are used, the VFQ-25 developers encourage users to incorporate all optional items for a given sub-scale. This strategy will enhance the comparability of results across studies.

Skip Question 1 when the VFQ-25 is administered at the same time as the SF-36 or RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0",,"PX111201",,,,,,,,,,"",""
