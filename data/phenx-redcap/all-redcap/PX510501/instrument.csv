A person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is related to a number of factors including the quantity of alcohol consumed, rate of consumption, gender, weight, and prior ingestion of food (Hingson et al., 1999; see Figure 1, p. 32). All states in the United States have adopted 0.08% (80 mg/dl) as the legal BAC limit for operating a motor vehicle for drivers aged 21 years or older (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). However, drivers younger than 21 are not allowed to operate a motor vehicle with any level of alcohol in their system. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) approves ""evidential breath testing devices"" (EBTs) with reliable results of 0.02% or greater. Although many breathalyzers measure BACs below 0.02% it is considered the lowest positive value. Note: Legal limits do not define a level below which it is safe to operate a vehicle or engage in some other activity. Impairment due to alcohol use can occur at levels well below the legal limit, starting at 0.01% (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 1994), and the level of impairment is positively related to BAC level. The following website link is for a table that generally summarizes these impairments, although the exact clinical presentation is highly varied by individual (Virginia Tech University, 2011): http://www.alcohol.vt.edu/Students/alcoholEffects/index.htm",,"PX510501",,,,,,,,,,"",""
