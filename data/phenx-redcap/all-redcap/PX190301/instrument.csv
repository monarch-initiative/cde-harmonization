Venipuncture should generally be performed using the median cubital, cephalic, or basilic veins in the left arm unless this arm is unsuitable. If the veins in the left arm are unsuitable, look for suitable veins on the right arm. If the veins in the antecubital space on both arms are not suitable, then look for veins in the forearm or dorsal side of the hand on the left arm/hand and then the right arm/hand.

For a full description of phlebotomy procedures, please refer to Chapter 4 in the downloadable PDF of the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Laboratory Procedures Manual available here: NHANES 2009-2010 Lab Manual",,"PX190301",,,,,,,,,,"",""
