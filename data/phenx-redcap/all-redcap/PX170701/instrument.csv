For men and women who are either aged 55 years or older or have had a tubal ligation or hysterectomy, the bone technician will explain and gather consent for the bone scan. For all other women, the bone technician will review the results of the pregnancy test. If the test is positive, the participant is excluded from the test and is asked to reschedule her scan. If the test is negative, the participant is asked whether she had intercourse in the past week. If the participant indicates the possibility of being pregnant, she is excluded from the test and is asked to reschedule her scan. Once the technician establishes that there is no risk of pregnancy, the technician will explain and gather consent for the bone scan.

The technician asks the participant to remove any metallic items such as rings, piercings, watches, or hair clips.

The technician asks the participant whether he or she has had hip implant/replacement to determine which hip to scan. If both hips have been replaced, the hip scan is not performed. The spine scan is completed regardless of any implants.


Prepare the participant for scan

The participant lies in middle of scanning table. The technician measures the participant's waist thickness at the belly button and hip thickness at the inferior iliac spine. The technician records the participant's name, ID, birth date, height, weight, gender, and ethnicity and notes any conditions that may affect DXA scan results.

Femur Scan

The technician makes sure that the participant is correctly positioned in the middle of the table and that the participant's pelvis is flat and that the spine is straight. The technician then correctly positions the leg and stabilizes it with a foot brace and tissue equivalent bags.

The technician monitors the scan image to make sure that the participant is properly positioned. If the scan is too high or too low, the scan is aborted and started again with a new start position. A correct femur image will show the greater trochanter, the femoral neck, and the ischium.

Spine Scan

The technician removes the foot brace and tissue equivalent bags and positions the participant for the spine scan. The technician uses a support block to elevate the participant's legs.

The technician monitors the scan image to make sure that the participant is properly positioned. If the scan is too high or too low, the scan is aborted and started again with a new start position. The technician notes any artifacts seen in the scan. A correct spine image will show the spine in the center, include all of L4, the top of L5 and approximately half of T12.",,"PX170701",,,,,,,,,,"",""

The technician adjusts the image so that the bone edges can be clearly seen and makes sure that the bone and tissue are correctly identified by the analysis software. The technician ensures the region of interest is correctly positioned as follows:

The Neck Region of Interest (ROI) does not include any portion of the greater trochanter
Soft tissue is contained in both ends of the Neck Region of Interest
The Neck Region of Interest (ROI) is perpendicular to the femoral neck.
The Neck Region of Interest (ROI), ideally, does not contain any portion of the ischium. If the ischium is include in the Neck Region of Interest (ROI), the program automatically types the bone as Neutral.

The technician adjusts the image so that the bone edges can be clearly seen and makes sure that the bone and tissue are correctly identified by the analysis software. The technician ensures the region of interest is correctly positioned as follows:

Make sure the intervertebral markers are between the vertebral bodies
Make sure the intervertebral markers are located at the lowest point of the bone density as indicated on the bone profile.
