THE INTERVIEW SCHEDULE

ORIENTATION TO THE TIME PERIOD

What we are going to do is a partially structured interview in which I will ask you about your eating habits and your feelings about your shape, and weight. Because a standard set of questions is going to be asked, please note that some may not apply to you.


Most of the questions focus on the past four weeks (that is, the last 28 days), but there will be some that extend out to cover the previous three months. I know this will test your memory because the weeks tend to blend together.

What I have done to help you is to make this calendar for the last 28 days [show the blank calendar - see Table 2]; it ends on yesterday because today is not over yet. So it goes from yesterday (day and date) to (day and date). I know it seems strange to have the weekends in the middle, but that is just the way it has worked out.

And here are the dates for the two months before that, (date) to (date). And to help you remember these periods, I have noted down the holidays (e.g., May Bank Holiday, Thanksgiving).

What I would like you to do now is tell me about any events that have happened in the past 28 days since this will help us discuss these four weeks. Have there been any events out of the ordinary .......... such as celebrations of any type, trips away or days off work? Then we can note these down on the calendar.

[These should be noted on the calendar (see Table 2) thereby allowing the interviewer and participant to use it as an aide memoire.]

INTRODUCTORY QUESTIONS

[Having oriented the participant to the specific time period being assessed, it is best to open the interview by asking a number of introductory questions designed to obtain a general picture of the participant's eating habits. Suitable questions are suggested below.]",,"PX230102",,,,,,,,,,"",""

Second, they provide subscales scores reflecting the severity of aspects of the psychopathology of eating disorders. The subscales are Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern and Weight Concern. To obtain a particular subscale score, the ratings for the relevant items (listed below) are added together and the sum divided by the total number of items forming the subscales. If ratings are only available on some items, a score may nevertheless be obtained by dividing the resulting total by the number of rated items so long as more than half the items have been rated.
