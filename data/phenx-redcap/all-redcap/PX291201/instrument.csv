Scoring Instructions

With the full scale, you can create a more extensive summary score for activity-friendliness.
a. Group responses 4 and 5 for item 1.
b. Reverse score items 1, 7, 8, 15 and 16.
c. Take a mean of items 1 through 17 (excluding item 11). This new overall PANES score should have a range of 1 to 4, with higher values indicating greater environmental support for physical activity. PANES subscales can also be created using the item grouping approach outlined below and in Sallis et al. 2010.

The items can be categorized into different constructs in case researchers want to look at the constructs separately:
Residential Density: item 1 (typically dichotomized as single family = 0 and all other = 1)
Land Use Mix: items 2 and 17
Transit Access: item 3
Pedestrian Infrastructure: items 4 and 13
Bicycling Infrastructure: items 5 and 14
Recreation Facilities: item 6
Street Connectivity: item 12
Crime Safety: items 7rev and 16rev
Traffic Safety: items 8rev and 15rev
Pedestrian Safety: item 9
Aesthetics: item 10
Item 11 (vehicles in household) is often used as a covariate in analyses",,,,,,,,,,,,,
