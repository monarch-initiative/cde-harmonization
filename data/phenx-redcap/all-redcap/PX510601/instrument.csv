"intendeduse","px510601_phenx_onsite_urine_drug_screen","Intended Use","descriptive","A CLIAwaived Multidrug Cup is an immunochromatographic assay for rapid, qualitative detection of drug combinations and their principal metabolites in urine at specified cut-off concentrations. The multidrug cup may be used to test any number of drugs, from a single drug up to 11 different drugs. The drug combinations may be composed of any of the following drugs, at the noted cut-off concentrations:",,"PX510601",,,,,,,,,,"",""

2. Urine specimens may be infectious; properly handle and dispose of urine in the toilet by draining it out of the test device. Fasten cap on the device and throw the empty urine cup in the garbage.

3. Visually inspect the foil package to insure it is intact. If the package is not intact, the integrity of the device might be compromised.",,"PX510601",,,,,,,,,,"",""

"specimen_inst_510601","px510601_phenx_onsite_urine_drug_screen","Specimen Collection and Preparation","descriptive","The CLIAwaived Multidrug device employs a thermal strip that should be checked immediately after collection to validate urine specimen. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) regulations specify that any temperature below 90.5°F must be considered adulterated. No additive or preservatives are required.

The Substance Abuse and Addiction Working Group identified the CLIAwaived Multidrug device as being the one used by SAMHSA. To aid comparability, the Working Group recommended that the investigator record the make and manufacturer of the device being used for testing.",,"PX510601",,,,,,,,,,"",""
"testproc_inst_510601","px510601_phenx_onsite_urine_drug_screen","Test Procedure","descriptive","1. Do not break the seal of the pouch until ready to begin testing.
2. Remove the test cup from the foil pouch.
3. Collect urine specimen directly into the test cup. 4. Ensure that the sample amount meets the minimum level as indicated on the side of the test cup.
Read the results at 5 minutes. Do not interpret results after 30 minutes.
Note: The result must be interpreted at five minutes. Waiting more than five minutes may cause the reading to be inaccurate. To avoid confusion, discard the test device after interpreting the result.",,"PX510601",,,,,,,,,,"",""

No color band appearing in the appropriate test zone (bottom band) indicates a preliminary positive result for the corresponding drug of that specific test zone. Send urine specimen to a certified laboratory for confirmation.

Negative: A rose-pink band is visible in each control zone and the appropriate test zone, indicating that the concentration of the corresponding drug of that specific test zone is below the detection limit of the test.

Invalid: If a color band is not visible in each of the control zones, the test is invalid. Another test should be run to re-evaluate the specimen.

Note: There is no meaning attributed to line color intensity or width.",,"PX510601",,,,,,,,,,"",""
"limit_inst_510601","px510601_phenx_onsite_urine_drug_screen","Limitations of the Test","descriptive","This product is designed to be used for the detection of drugs of abuse and their metabolites in human urine only.
Although the test is very accurate, there is the possibility false results will occur due to the presence of interfering substances in the specimen sample.
The test is a qualitative screening assay and is not suggested for quantitative determination of drug levels in urine, or the level of intoxication.
Adulterants such as bleach or other strong oxidizing agents, when added to urine specimens, can cause erroneous test results regardless of the analysis method used.
If adulteration is suspected, obtain another urine specimen.",,"PX510601",,,,,,,,,,"",""
