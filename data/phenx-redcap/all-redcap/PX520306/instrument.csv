"scoring_520306","px520306_phenx_selfreported_craving_specific_tobacco",,"descriptive","Scoring Procedure and Interpretation

Several scoring schemes have been proposed, and in all of these, the items are averaged or summed to yield factor scores. The initial scoring scheme proposed by Cox et al. (2001) and later partially confirmed by Toll et al. (2006) had two factors:

Factor 1 included items 1, 3, 6, 7, and 10
Factor 2 included items 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9
The score for each factor is calculated by summing the item scores; the total score is calculated by summing all 10 items.

Toll et al. (2006) found that the most robust items from the Cox et al. (2001) analysis revealed the best fit in a confirmatory factor analysis, again with two factors: Factor 1 included items 1 and 6, and Factor 2 included items 4, 8, and 9. These items and factor titles are:

Factor 1 - Intention/Desire to Smoke

I have a desire for a cigarette right now.
I have an urge for a cigarette.

Factor 2 - Relief of Negative Affect & Urgent Desire to Smoke

I could control things better right now if I could smoke.
I would do almost anything for a cigarette right now.
Smoking would make me less depressed.
The scoring scheme reflects factors identified in the original publications. Factor structure may differ in individual studies.",,"PX520306",,,,,,,,,,"",""
