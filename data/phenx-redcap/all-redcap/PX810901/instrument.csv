Editor's Note: Please review chapter 4 of the Laboratory Procedures Manual from the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for a full description of phlebotomy procedures. This manual is posted here, and is also available at the NHANES website: 2011-2012 NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual.

Venipuncture should generally be performed using the median cubital, cephalic, or basilic veins in the left arm unless this arm is unsuitable. If the veins in the left arm are unsuitable, look for suitable veins on the right arm. If the veins in the antecubital space on both arms are not suitable, then look for veins in the forearm or dorsal side of the hand on the left arm/hand and then the right arm/hand.


Recording the Results of the Venipuncture Procedure

Immediately after completing the venipuncture, record the results of the blood draw, the reasons for a tube not being drawn according to the protocol, and any comments about the venipuncture.",,"PX810901",,,,,,,,,,"",""

Please review chapter 8 of the Laboratory Procedures Manual from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2012 for a full description of blood processing procedures: 2011-2012 NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual.

Allow the blood to clot by setting aside for 30 to 45 minutes at room temperature. Do not clot for more than an hour.
Centrifuge the tube at room temperature to separate the serum and aliquot into an appropriate storage tube.
Determine if the serum is hemolyzed, turbid, lipemic, or icteric. If so, enter a comment to describe the serum.
There are many methods and recommended blood volumes for neonatal and pediatric bilirubin measurements.

Neonatal blood collection - volumes may change depending on the laboratory but volumes as low as 0.1mL in a green or red top tube have been used.
Pediatric blood collection - volumes may change depending on the laboratory but volumes as low as 0.5mL in a green or red top tube have been used.",,"PX810901",,,,,,,,,,"",""

The Sickle Cell Disease Cardiovascular, Pulmonary, and Renal Working Group notes that there are a number of different assays and instruments that are appropriate to measure the concentration of total bilirubin. Once an assay is chosen for a particular study, the Working Group recommends that no changes in the protocol be made over the course of the study. To aid comparability, the Working Group recommends that the investigator record the make and manufacturer of equipment used and the repeatability and coefficients of variation for the assay.",,"PX810901",,,,,,,,,,"",""
