Instructions to interviewer: These scales establish the lethality of patients' suicide attempt(s). Use all available information to establish the lethality of each previous suicide attempt.

Enter the date (MM/YY) of each suicide attempt, then code the lethality of each suicide attempt, starting with the MOST recent suicide attempt. If the patient used more than one method, code each method, beginning with the MOST lethal. (Example: on 12/1/95, a patient attempted suicide by consuming a liter of grain alcohol and a gunshot to the abdomen. This would be coded as date: 12/95; primary code 0306; secondary code 0104.)",,"PX640401",,,,,,,,,,"",""
