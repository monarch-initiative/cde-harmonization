Intensity

A representative area of eczema is selected for each body region. The intensity of redness (erythema), thickness (induration, papulation, oedema), scratching (excoriation) and lichenification (lined skin) of the eczema is assessed as none/absent (0), mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3).
