To do this, we would like you to fill out the attached calendar.

&#10003; Filling out the calendar is not hard!

&#10003; Try to be as accurate as possible.

&#10003;  We recognize you won't have perfect recall. That's OKAY.

&#10003; WHAT TO FILL IN

&#149;The idea is to record how many cigarettes you smoked for each day on the calendar.

&#149;On days when you did not smoke cigarettes, not even one, you should write a ""0.""

It's important that something is written for every day, even if it is a 0"".

&#10003; YOUR BEST ESTIMATE

&#149;We realize it isn't easy to recall things with 100% accuracy.

&#149;If you are not sure whether you smoked 15 or 16 cigarettes or whether you smoked on a Thursday or a Friday, give it your best guess! What is important is that 15 or 16 cigarettes is very different from 1 cigarette. The goal is to get a sense of how frequently you smoked, how much you smoked, and your patterns of smoking.

&#10003;HELPFUL HINTS

&#149;If you have an appointment book you can use it to help you recall your use.

&#149;Holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas are marked on the calendar to help you recall your smoking. Also, think about how much you smoked on personal holidays & events such as birthdays, vacations, or parties.

&#149;If you have regular patterns to your smoking, you can use these to help you recall your use. For example, some people may only smoke during social situations.

&#10003; COMPLETING THE CALENDAR

&#149;A blank calendar is attached. Write in the number of cigarettes you smoked on each day.

&#149;The time period we are talking about on the calendar is

from ________________________ to _______________________.

&#149;In estimating the number of cigarettes you smoked, be as accurate as possible.

&#149;DOUBLE CHECK THAT ALL DAYS ARE FILLED IN BEFORE RETURNING THE CALENDAR.
