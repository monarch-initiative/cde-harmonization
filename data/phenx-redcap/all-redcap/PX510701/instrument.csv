The participant is asked to urinate into a sterile 90 ml urine specimen container. Specimen collection should be observed to prevent specimen adulteration or substitution. Specimens should be refrigerated immediately after collection and aliquoted into a 4 ml cryovial (for each drug type being tested) within 48 hours. Cryovials should be frozen at -20?C until analysis. Specimens should be analyzed within 2 months of collection.",,"PX510701",,,,,,,,,,"",""

Enzyme immunoassay should be employed to detect the marijuana metabolite ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCCOOH). The assay will reliably detect marijuana metabolite concentrations greater than 50 ng/ml.

Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric or liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis should be employed to accurately detect THCCOOH concentrations greater than 15 ng/ml.

Cannabis detection window

a) It has been reported that after occasional use, 11-nor-9-carboxy-?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) concentrations in urine remain above 15 ng/ml after alkaline hydrolysis for up to 4 days (Huestis et al., 1996).

b) Urinary THCCOOH detection windows range from several days in infrequent users to months in frequent users (Ellis et al., 1985; Peat, 1989; Kelly & Jones, 1992; Fraser & Worth, 2003; Lowe et al., 2009).

c) Differentiating new cannabis use from prolonged urinary excretion in chronic users is difficult. Several mathematical approaches for identifying new cannabis use based upon creatinine corrected THCCOOH urinary concentrations have been reported (Huestis et al., 1998; Schwilke et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2009).

d) Research continues to identify biomarkers for directly distinguishing new cannabis use (Skopp & Potsch, 2002; Mareck et al., 2009; Weinmann et al., 2000).",,"PX510701",,,,,,,,,,"",""

Cocaine detection window

The Drugs of Abuse Reference Guide indicates the urine screening cutoff for cocaine detection is 300 ng/ml. National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) clinical trials also use this concentration as the threshold. GCMS can confirm a concentration of 150 ng/ml or greater.

To be positive for methamphetamine, a specimen must exceed 250 ng/ml methamphetamine and contain more than 100 ng/ml of amphetamine.

Following a single 1.0 or 1.6 mg/kg oral administration of MDMA, urine specimens were unlikely to contain more than 250 ng/ml of MDMA for more than 48 hrs after dosing (n = 16) (Abraham et al., 2009).",,"PX510701",,,,,,,,,,"",""

In general, a positive result, i.e., the presence of drug is detected in an enzyme immunoassay, indicates that the individual has ingested the drug, or a drug in the same chemical class, within the window of detection. Not all positive drug screens are due to illicit drug use or are confirmed. Drugs taken in low doses or at times outside of the window of detection may not result in a positive drug screen.",,"PX510701",,,,,,,,,,"",""
