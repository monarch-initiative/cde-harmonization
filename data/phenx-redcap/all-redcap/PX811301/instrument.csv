Editor's Note: Please review chapter 4 of the Laboratory Procedures Manual from the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for a full description of phlebotomy procedures. This manual is posted here, and is also available at the NHANES website: www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_09_10/lab.pdf

Venipuncture should generally be performed using the median cubital, cephalic, or basilic veins in the left arm unless this arm is unsuitable. If the veins in the left arm are unsuitable, look for suitable veins on the right arm. If the veins in the antecubital space on both arms are not suitable, then look for veins in the forearm or dorsal side of the hand on the left arm/hand and then the right arm/hand.

Fill a 3 or 4 ml K3 EDTA tube with blood.


Recording the Results of the Venipuncture Procedure

Immediately after completing the venipuncture, record the results of the blood draw, the reasons for a tube not being drawn according to the protocol, and any comments about the venipuncture. Collection tube should be standardized across the study duration.",,"PX811301",,,,,,,,,,"",""

The Sickle Cell Disease Cardiovascular, Pulmonary, and Renal Working Group notes that there are a number of different assays and instruments that are appropriate to measure ferritin. Once an assay is chosen for a particular study, the Working Group recommends that no changes in the protocol be made over the course of the study. To aid comparability, the Working Group recommends that the investigator record the make and manufacturer of equipment used and the repeatability and coefficients of variation for the assay.",,"PX811301",,,,,,,,,,"",""
"ranges_811301","px811301_phenx_serum_or_plasma_ferritin",,"descriptive","Reference Ranges (Normal Values) for Ferritin

Ferritin reference ranges are assay-specific. The Roche Diagnostics kit used by NHANES specifies expected values of 30-400 ng/mL for men and 13-150 ng/mL for women.
