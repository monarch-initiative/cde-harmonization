Each item is scored on a scale ranging from 1 for ""Strongly Disagree"" to 7 for ""Strongly Agree."" The scores from items 1-3, 5, 6, and 8-10 are used as the raw scores. Items 4 and 7 should be reverse-scored (raw score = 8 minus reverse-keyed item score) (Heinz et al., 2006). A total score is obtained by averaging all items (Sussner et al., 2006).",,"PX520302",,,,,,,,,,"",""
