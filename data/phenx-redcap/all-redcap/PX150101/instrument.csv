First, obtain the participant's weight in pounds via a reliable scale, and also record his/her sex, and current age. Secure the HR monitor chest strap and watch to the participant. Explain that you will time the participant as he/she walks as quickly as possible for one-mile.

Once the participant is ready at the starting line, say ""go"" and start the stopwatch. Time the participant until he/she completes the entire 1 mile walk. Record the time in minutes and seconds and then convert to seconds [(minutes x 60) + seconds].",,"PX150101",,,,,,,,,,"",""
