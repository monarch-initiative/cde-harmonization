Now let's begin the evaluation. I would now like you to try to move your body in different movements. I will first describe and show each movement to you. Then I'd like you to try to do it. If you cannot do a particular movement, or if you feel it would be unsafe to try to do it, tell me and we'll move on to the next one. Let me emphasize that I do not want you to try to do any exercise that you feel might be unsafe.


Do you have any questions before we begin?

A. Side-by-Side Stand

1. Now I will show you the first movement.

2. (Demonstrate) I want you to try to stand with your feet together, side-by-side, for about 10 seconds.

3. You may use your arms, bend your knees, or move your body to maintain your balance, but try not to move your feet. Try to hold this position until I tell you to stop.

4. Stand next to the participant to help him/her into the side-by-side position.

5. Supply just enough support to the participant's arm to prevent loss of balance.

6. When the participant has his/her feet together, ask ""Are you ready?""

7. Then let go and begin timing as you say, ""Ready, begin.""

8. Stop the stopwatch and say ""Stop"" after 10 seconds or when the participant steps out of position or grabs your arm.

9. If participant is unable to hold the position for 10 seconds, record result and go to the gait speed test.",,"PX150501",,,,,,,,,,"",""
