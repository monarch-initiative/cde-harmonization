A score of 1 = an inability to complete the item and a score of 5 = no difficulty experienced at all. Summative scores are generated for each domain. Domain scores range from 0-100.

The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is scored in the following way, for each domain:

Transformed Scale = [(Actual raw score - lowest possible raw score) / Possible raw score range] x 100

Three items in the emotion domain, 3f, 3h, and 3i, are reverse-scored, i.e., 1 becomes 5, 2 becomes 4, 3 remains the same, 4 becomes 2, and 5 becomes 1, prior to manual calculation. For these items, use the following equation to compute the individual's score:

6 - individual's rating = item score

The last item assesses the participant's overall perception of recovery and is presented in the form of a visual analog scale from 0 to 100, where 0 = ""no recovery"" and 100 = ""full recovery.""",,"PX820701",,,,,,,,,,"",""
