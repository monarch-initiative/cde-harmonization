"intro_220301","px220301_phenx_bone_age",,"descriptive","The Tanner-Whitehouse Test is an online tool which was developed by Lorentz Jantschi and Sorana Bolboaca and is available at:

<a href=""http://vl.academicdirect.org/medical_informatics/bone_age/v1.0/"" target=""_blank"">vl.academicdirect.org/medical_informatics/bone_age/v1.0/</a>

The tool describes various findings associated with each of the following 20 regions of interest (ROI) of the left hand as seen on x-ray. The ROIs are the:

Radius
Ulna
First, third, and fifth metacarpal
Proximal phalanx of the thumb, third finger, and fifth finger
Middle phalanx of the third and fifth finger
Distal phalanx of the thumb, third finger, and fifth finger
Capitate
Hamate
Triquetral
Lunate
Scaphoid
Trapezium
Trapezoid


Users select a finding that matches what they see on the x-ray. Each finding has two x-ray images, a drawing and a written description. Once a selection is made for each ROI, the users enters the patient's name*, address, x-ray date, diagnostic, gender, weight, height and age (in years and months, for example 11 years and 3 months). Then the program calculates the individual's bone age based upon the standard atlas associated with the Tanner and Whitehouse method. *See Specific Instructions for suggestions regarding personal identifying information.",,"PX220301",,,,,,,,,,"",""
