A. Items 1, 4 and 14 are reverse scored. Items 1-12 and 14 are summed.

B. Item 13 is not included in the total score, but is used to rule out the parasomnia, Nocturnal Sleep Related Eating Disorder (NS-RED).

C. Item 15 is not added to the total score, but instead is used as a descriptor of the course of the symptoms.

D. Items 16 and 17 are used to confirm the presence of distress or impairment if NES is present.

A score of 25 or greater is suggestive of night eating syndrome, and a score of 30 and above is a strong indicator of NES, but we suggest that the answers are reviewed with the patient in an interview before a firm diagnosis is made. For example, many patients with night eating symptoms over-estimate their intake at night. Also, if patients are

depressed in the late evening and have trouble falling asleep, but only minimal night eating, this could inflate their scores.",,"PX230601",,,,,,,,,,"",""
