Scoring instructions are adapted from the handout ""Using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV (PCL)"" available from the National Center for PTSD at www.ptsd.va.gov.

A total symptom severity score (range = 17-85) can be obtained by summing the scores from each of the 17 items that have response options ranging from 1 ""Not at all"" to 5 ""Extremely.""

A provisional diagnosis can be established in three ways:

1) Determine whether an individual meets DSM-IV symptom criteria as defined by at least 1 B item (questions 1-5), 3 C items (questions 6-12), and at least 2 D items (questions 13-17). Symptoms that are rated as ""Moderately"" or above (responses 3 through 5 on individual items) are counted as present.

2) Determine whether the total severity score exceeds a relevant normative threshold (e.g., for primary care settings).

3) Combine methods (1) and (2) to ensure that an individual meets both the symptom pattern and severity threshold.",,"PX630301",,,,,,,,,,"",""
