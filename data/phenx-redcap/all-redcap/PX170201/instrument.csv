The Radiographic Procedure Manual for Examinations of the Knee, Hand, Pelvis and Lower Limbs is designed for obtaining radiographs by use of conventional radiographic equipment with exposure of radiographic film. The manual also contains information for applying its procedures with the use of digital radiographic equipment.

The manual contains information for preparing X-ray participants, proper participant positioning, and information for assisting participants in maintaining proper positioning.

In addition, the manual contains instructions for obtaining unilateral posteroanterior (PA) fixed flexion knee radiographs with fluoroscopy, PA semiflexed knee radiographs with fluoroscopy, lateral knee radiographs for controls, and unilateral and bilateral hand radiographs (including pictures of proper and improper positioning), positioning of the X-ray tube, documentation, and quality control.

Instructions for obtaining the Radiographic Procedure Manual for Examinations of the Knee, Hand, Pelvis and Lower Limbs can be found in the Source section. Sections 3.3 and 3.6-3.8 of this manual are for obtaining knee radiographs. The first part of section 3.4 (pages 24-36) is for obtaining hand radiographs, whereas the second part of section 3.4 (pages 37-42) is for obtaining pelvic radiographs, which include the hip joints.
