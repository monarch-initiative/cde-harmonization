For items 1, 2, 4, 6, 7: Strongly Agree=3, Agree=2, Disagree=1, and Strongly Disagree=0.

For items 3, 5, 8, 9, 10 (which are reversed in valence, and noted with the asterisks**): Strongly Agree=0, Agree=1, Disagree=2, and Strongly Disagree=3.

The scale ranges from 0-30, with 30 indicating the highest score possible. Other scoring options are possible. For example, you can assign values 1-4 rather than 0-3; then scores will range from 10-40. Some researchers use 5- or 7-point Likert scales, and again, scale ranges would vary based on the addition of ""middle"" categories of agreement.",,"PX180901",,,,,,,,,,"",""
