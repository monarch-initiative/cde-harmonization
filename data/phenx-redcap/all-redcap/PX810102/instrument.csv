• There are many different types of oral thermometers that are appropriate for this protocol. Investigators should follow the manufacturer's recommendations for calibration and measurement.

• Place the thermometer probe in the sublingual pocket for the full measuring period. This period is determined by the amount of time needed for the probe's temperature to equilibrate with the contact area and varies depending upon the type of thermometer used. For example, a few seconds is needed for an electronic contact thermometer in predictive mode and one minute is required for a chemical phase change thermometer.

• Read the thermometer and record the temperature.
