The three subscreeners consist of the following items:

     1a to 1e for the Internalizing Disorder Screener (IDScr)
     2a to 2e for the Externalizing Disorder Screener   (EDScr)
     3a to 3e for the Substance Disorder Screener (SDScr)

The count of past-month (3's) responses is used as a measure of change. The count of past-year (3's or 2's) responses is used to predict past year/current diagnosis. The count of lifetime (3's, 2's, or 1's) responses is used to predict lifetime diagnosis. Counts are triaged into low (0 symptoms), moderate (1-2 symptoms), and high (3 or more symptoms) severity. Remission overall or in a given area is defined as lifetime ""moderate/high"" severity but no symptoms in the past month (early) or past year (sustained).

Be sure to count, instead of sum, the raw answers. For example, if the client's responses for the items in the IDScr were:

1a = 3 (past month)

1b = 2 (2-12 months ago)

1c = 3 (past month)

1d = 1 (more than 12 months ago)

1e = 0 (never)

Then, the IDScr past year score would be 3, since 1a, 1b, and 1c reflect past-year symptoms. The past-month version would be the count of the 3's, and lifetime would be the count of 1's, 2's, and 3's.",,"PX580101",,,,,,,,,,"",""
