Second, they provide subscale scores reflecting the severity of aspects of the psychopathology of eating disorders. The subscales are Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern and Weight Concern. To obtain a particular subscale score, the ratings for the relevant items (listed below) are added together and the sum divided by the total number of items forming the subscales. If ratings are only available on some items, a score may nevertheless be obtained by dividing the resulting total by the number of rated items so long as more than half the items have been rated.
