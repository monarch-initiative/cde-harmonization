scoring_instructions,px281601_religious_behaviors_congregational_support,,descriptive,"Scoring Instructions

Subscales can be scored independently, or an overall score may be generated by standardizing items and then summing them. For all scale scores, lower scores are indicative of higher levels of spirituality and religious practices. For an overall sum score, lower scores represent low levels of spirituality and religion, and higher scores represent greater levels of spirituality and religion.

Standardizing the items will make conducting further factor analyses possible. Scores can be standardized either using z-scores or so that their scaling is equivalent (i.e., each item scaled on a range of 0 to 3). The five subscales consisting of a 4-point answer format (Meaning, Values/Beliefs, Forgiveness, Religious and Spiritual Coping, and Religious Support) may be transformed from a 1 to 4 range to a 0 to 3 range by subtracting 1.0 from the actual score for each item. For the Daily Spiritual Experience and Organizational Religiousness subscales, which had a 6-point response format, 1.0 can be subtracted from the actual score, which can then be multiplied by 3/5. For the four items that used an 8-point range on the Private Religious Practices scale, 1.0 can be subtracted from the actual score, which can then be multiplied by 3/7. For one item with a 5-point range on Private Religious Practices, 1.0 can be subtracted from the actual score, which may then be multiplied by ¾.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
