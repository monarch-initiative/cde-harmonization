The procedure is explained, emphasizing the need to avoid leaks around the mouthpiece during the washout and using a nose clip; 4) Patient breathes on the mouthpieces for ~30-60 seconds to become accustomed to the apparatus and to assure a stable end-tidal expiratory level; 5) when breathing is stable and consistent with the end-tidal volume being at FRC, the patient is switched into the circuit so that 100% oxygen is inspired instead of room air; 6) The nitrogen concentration is monitored during the washout. A change in inspired N2 of >1% or sudden large increases in expiratory N2 concentrations indicate a leak; hence the test should be stopped and repeated after a 15-minute period of breathing room air.

The procedure is explained, emphasizing the need to avoid leaks around the mouthpiece during the washout and using a nose clip; 5) The patient breathes for ~30-60 seconds on the mouthpiece to become accustomed to the apparatus and to ensure a stable end-tidal expiratory level; 6) The patient is turned 'in' (i.e. connected to the test gas) at the end of a normal tidal expiration; 7) The patient is instructed to breathe regular tidal breathes; 8) The O2 flow is adjusted to compensate for O2 consumption (significant errors in the calculation of FRC can result in O2 consumption is not adequately accounted for); 9) The helium concentration is noted ever 15s; 10) Helium equilibration is considered to be complete when the change in helium concentration is < 0.02% for 30 seconds. The test rarely exceeds 10 minutes, even in patients with severe gas-exchange abnormalities; 11) Once the helium equilibration is complete, the patient is turned 'out' (i.e. disconnected from the test gas) of the system; 12) At least one technically satisfactory measurement should be obtained.
