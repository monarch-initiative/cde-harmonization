The CAPS-IV is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to:

Make current (past month) or lifetime diagnosis of PTSD
Provide a continuous index of PTSD severity
Assess PTSD symptoms over the past week
In addition to assessing DSM-IV PTSD symptoms, questions target the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, and impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, and features of dissociation (depersonalization and derealization). Most symptom severity ratings are anchored to a combination of symptom frequency and intensity; only amnesia and diminished interest are anchored to amount of disturbance and intensity.

Administration requires identification of three index traumatic events to serve as the basis for symptom inquiry. The Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5, see Trauma Adversity and Exposure) is recommended prior to the Criterion A inquiry included in the CAPS-IV. Standardized questions and probes are provided for each symptom.

The CAPS was designed to be administered by clinicians and clinical researchers who have a working knowledge of PTSD, but can also be administered by appropriately trained paraprofessionals. The full interview takes 45-60 minutes to administer.",,"PX630401",,,,,,,,,,"",""

"scoring_630401","px630401_phenx_ptsd_symptoms_severity_and_diagnosis_dsmiv",,"descriptive","Scoring:

It is recommended that the ""1, 2"" rule be used to determine a diagnosis; that is, a frequency score of 1 (scale 0 = ""none of the time"" to 4 = ""most or all of the time"") and an intensity score of 2 (scale 0 = ""none"" to 4 = ""extreme"") is required for a particular symptom to meet criterion (Weathers et al., 1999). The diagnosis is then made according to the DSM-IV algorithm:

• At least one Criterion B symptom,

• At least three Criterion C symptoms,

• At least two Criterion D symptoms,

• Criterion A is met,

• Criterion E is met, and

• Criterion F is met.

A severity score for each symptom is calculated by summing the frequency and intensity scores, which can then be summed for all 17 symptom questions and/or for the three symptom clusters.",,"PX630401",,,,,,,,,,"",""
