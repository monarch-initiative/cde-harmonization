2) Place the subject's arm in a relaxed position across his abdomen or lower chest.

3) Observe a complete respiratory cycle (one inspiration and one expiration).

4) Count the number of respiration for 60 seconds. For adults with regular respiratory rhythm, it may be adequate to count for 30 seconds and multiply by two.

5) While counting, note whether depth is shallow, normal, or deep, and whether rhythm is normal or an altered pattern.
