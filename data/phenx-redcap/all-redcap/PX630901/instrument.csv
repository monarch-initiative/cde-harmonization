Skin conductance (SC): Any device that records continuously at a rate of 5 samples per second or higher. Add isotonic paste to metal part of electrodes and attach them to fingers.

Heart rate (HR): Any device that records continuously at a rate of 20 samples per second or higher. Attach to finger (devices such as pulse oximeters) or wrist (for watch devices).

Once device is attached, verify that data is being recorded (either by visual or numerical representation of the data).",,"PX630901",,,,,,,,,,"",""
