COMPUTATION

We score the scaled as average ratings across the relevant sub-dimension items. Items with missing ratings can be excluded from the denominator. For example, the health concerns score = Sum of items (1 + 5 + 9 + 13 + 17)/5

If item #9 is missing data, the calculation would be the sum of items (1 + 5 + 13 + 17)/4

Level of intrinsic relative to extrinsic motivation is calculated as a difference score with the extrinsic scale score subtracted from the intrinsic score.",,"PX710502",,,,,,,,,,"",""
