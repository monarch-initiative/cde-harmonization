"scoring_650201","px650201_phenx_exercise_dependence_scale",,"descriptive","Scoring:

The proposed scoring procedure for the Exercise Dependence Scale is computer based, which allows for immediate and accurate scoring. The computer scoring of the Exercise Dependence Scale is based on the SPSS (Statistic Package for the Social Sciences). A syntax file (see https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.si.all&nimh=true) has been developed by the authors that enables immediate feedback to the Exercise Dependence Scale responses once the items are entered into SPSS. The syntax enables:

1. Computing a total and subscale mean scores for Exercise Dependence Scale-21. A higher score indicates more exercise-dependent symptoms.

2. Categorizing participants into either at-risk for exercise dependent, nondependent-symptomatic, or nondependent-asymptomatic groups. The categorization into one of the three groups is generated by a scoring manual that consists of flowchart decision rules in which items or combinations or items determine if an individual would be classified in the dependent, symptomatic, or asymptomatic range on each of the 7 DSM IV criteria. Individuals who are classified into the dependent range on 3 or more of the DSM criteria are classified as exercise dependence. The dependent range is operationalized as indicating a score of 5 or 6 for that item. Individuals who scored in the 3 to 4 range are classified as symptomatic. These individuals may theoretically be considered at-risk for exercise dependence. Finally, individuals who score in the 1-2 range are classified as asymptomatic.",,"PX650201",,,,,,,,,,"",""
