"info_720401","px720401_phenx_nnal_in_urine",,"descriptive","NNAL is measured by using liquid chromatography linked to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For ""total"" NNAL assays, the urine sample is fortified with an NNAL-13C6 internal standard, and then hydrolyzed using ?-glucuronidase in incubations for at least 24 hours. The samples are then extracted on a supported liquid extraction cartridge, followed by liquid-liquid extraction and finally cleaned up on a specially-designed solid-phase molecularly-imprinted polymer (MIP) column, after which the analyte is eluted and analyzed by LC/MS/MS, monitoring the m/z 210->180 native, and m/z 216->186 internal standard transition ions. NNAL concentrations are derived from the ratio of the integrated peaks of native to labeled ions by comparison to a standard calibration curve. Free NNAL measurements are conducted in a similar manner, but with the omission of prior enzymatic hydrolysis. Bound NNAL (e.g. NNAL-Gluc) may be estimated from the difference of (Total NNAL - Free NNAL). Prior to assaying each run of unknowns, the results from standard analyses are reviewed for acceptable accuracy, precision and instrument sensitivity. The results from the 20 calibration standards analyzed prior to each run are reviewed daily. Acceptable back-calculated values for standards above the detection limit are typically in the range of nominal concentration ± 10%. The limit of detection is 0.6 pg/mL. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) is the preferred method to accurately measure NNAL in urine samples (see source references for details).",,"PX720401",,,,,,,,,,"",""
