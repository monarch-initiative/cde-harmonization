# CDE Harmonization repo

This repo is for the initial stage of CDE harmonization where we simply try and collect as many CDEs as possible and dump them here
in their native format.

Additional context in these slides from Chris: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kt-7fwYNh2fJru-Psk73XciokeHSkbqmsR-C6VUHLUQ/edit#slide=id.p

THIS REPO SHOULD REMAIN PRIVATE
