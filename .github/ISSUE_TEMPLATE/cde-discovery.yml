        ## AI-Powered CDE Discovery
        
        This template will trigger our AI system to search across all CDE sources (PhenX, NIH/NLM, CADSR, RADx-UP) to find data elements matching your research needs.
        
        The AI will analyze your request and provide:
        - Ranked list of relevant CDEs with confidence scores
        - Detailed explanations of why each CDE matches your criteria
        - File locations and LinkML schema references
        - Suggestions for harmonization opportunities
